You know what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, more read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> as a farmer, or with leather clothes, and you never have a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that was going somewhere else.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk> did.
It's the kind of a complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school, in the middle school, <unk> <unk> where I was the weird class.
When I got to bleed up to bleed every week in the bathroom of kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life to let me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had an thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working on organizations that fight AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults we never get to know us.
You could teach it to Ohio and please bring that man you already found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to relate to this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it one place, the <unk> and the <unk> and we had her family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a <unk> box and went into my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was made present in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the her.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what I was in front of me.
I took them around about the water <unk> almost 60 feet -- and I was not able to think that it was a <unk> <unk> on another <unk> of snow year after year.
<unk> are born when they get out of the glaciers or the walls of ice.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give them and hold up until the end of the others -- while others can't afford them, more and <unk> in a passion of passionate <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and themselves, largely as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
So as a <unk> is <unk> and I'm breathing up his honorable atmosphere.
As a iceberg releases freshwater rich in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I get up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, so we know that in these unique moments there are in that way and will never come back to there again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but one step on their way for life cycle.
Part of the ice <unk> I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you is a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's just frequent to get to witness a <unk> <unk>
Here they go.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a iceberg <unk>
<unk> of the water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, a baby. Okay.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want it to be too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about reality, you're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is joined by the X X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X chromosome is tied to the X X chromosome.
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll come back to talk about them later.
In my ground, they would get two roles.
In one of my roles -- I work with the story of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training, and what I study in this case is the way people are looking at the anatomy -- which is, of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered the body fluids -- what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with twins <unk> two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with sex sex, individuals whose physical <unk> don't fit into male <unk> and feminine <unk>
It's general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes a lot of ways.
I'm going to put a few examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't fit into male or a female <unk>
For example, there's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> and says to the <unk> that we all have in the life that we have in the life that they become <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, the testicles are making testosterone.
But because this individual is none of testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk>
So, there are high levels of testosterone but without feedback.
As a result, the body develops on a course typically <unk>
When I <unk> the baby looks like a little girl.
It's a girl. It's raised as a girl.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing breast cells, but it doesn't have the space period, when someone realizes something is happening.
Then you realize that rather than <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think of a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, as men, as men, we have in the body something called <unk> glands, <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women as I -- I think a <unk> woman doesn't know his <unk> structure, and I think to be a typical woman, most women as I am <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> than the woman who was born with testicles that have the <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
That's why sex is complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way you can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19-year-old <unk> born and raised like <unk> he had girlfriend, and she was wearing a life as a boy and I had just found out that he had ovaries and <unk>
It had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had the 20th chromosomes and the uterus -- <unk> glands, were so active that they essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a result, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone hormone typically the male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk>
And it was at the age of 19 when he started having the medical problems by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was women inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> -- that they have <unk> tissue, wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there's lots of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies are actually <unk> twins or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is not to be able to have better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it <unk> several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity -- it will be black it means to have African anatomy in terms of <unk>
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when we have a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very challenging ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the <unk> very romantic.
So imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people inside a body.
The highest case is last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> put in the trial of trial in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters called to ask, "What test are going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, more we need to admit that these categories -- to us -- we were thinking were <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories -- are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology would be.
So as we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do we mean by the fact that they made <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we go into science we get more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too much <unk>
And we're looking at this in all of the <unk> of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set a moment from which a body becomes human and it has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today in day <unk> not in public, but I know inside the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to get them with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him put a pen in front of the nose and it was still not <unk>
If I stopped moving him up.
But we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with a dilemma of actually figuring out somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm liberal, <unk> to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that he gives me nervous.
I think these categories are much more fragile than we thought about it.
<unk> from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I am a <unk> a <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical about what they did, that I find that <unk> <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
This is why it happened in <unk> with the Parents <unk>
The fathers were <unk> to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain it why.
What they did -- it was a <unk> concept, and they had it with another which was radical and beautiful and remained for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what we <unk> our parents, <unk> was the idea of the <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was going to be able to be able to be passed through the head of blood passed from the grandfather to the father and then the son, and so on.
The parents said, <unk> rejected that idea and replace it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not <unk> differences, and that was a very radical thing.
And they were doing it because they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it remains very clear, if you look at the history of the adoptive parents, that a lot of them were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> being passed through a vague <unk>
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of opera -- they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a result, they were broadcasting the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future of Rights <unk>
They didn't think of it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women.
Then they came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color that were going to be able to make a coincidence of a coincidence of difference -- and again, they will be <unk>
We see the same thing with the motion of the <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we have certain <unk>
But, attention, I want to keep some divided into our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish to the same rights that a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> in anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five year-old kids are supposed to allow you to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me to make sense and that I think we should support them.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things: <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
So imagine that one of them, love was born three months before time, June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was born in term, was born on March 1 1980.
By the fact that I had been born three months before Mary are attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that because it has a different biological age, but because it was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, by virtue of being considered man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered to be a man now -- it's <unk> the compulsory <unk> of which Mary doesn't have to worry.
Mary, on the hand, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories that are still <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science has been moving both in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of attitude attitude -- "Well, we have to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at a certain point has decided to marry a man -- you don't have to have a chromosome, and that to marry a woman you have to have a <unk>
Now, in practice they don't make people tested for people.
But this is also very strange because of the story that I told you to the beginning of <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I love <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> they go beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very good."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this for human rights to people, because I will admit that I know some of the <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent <unk> intelligent and <unk> about their sexual relationships that I know.
So how do you put the theme of the contents of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And a part of me ask you what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
We want to really get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to continue this current thinking of thinking in relation to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is <unk> to be killed unless he is willing to have a change of sex, in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context of a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made a couple of years ago to give birth twins and then pick them off their fame.
But when the phone asked him the reason for the operation, he was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, he's considered the political asylum. Instead of <unk> <unk>
United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change the same state of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to finish up, I mean, I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we had more involvement in <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for an O. and that is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking in a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women on average, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers I knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I thought I was interested in <unk> it made me a <unk>
Do you know what's about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the <unk> question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking <unk> <unk> so there's nothing else in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about your question, the more I have something like there is female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different among the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships to help the most vulnerable.
So while the parents were very close to find the way to protect people by the state, it is possible that they have made more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the universal support of support.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we bring to democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect thing, we think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In year 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go to live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now we're far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with one city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than their cost cost.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may be absurd if you never thought about new cities.
But they simply replaced by the buildings of apartments.
So imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartment are already owners and that the other half is still not going to be able to do it.
They could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas that surround them have rules to avoid <unk> and the aggregate of the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a completely new place, to build a whole new apartment building and then and when the rules of that place <unk> the construction instead of building <unk>
And so I proposed that governments were <unk> new programs of reform big enough to contain cities and gave them a name of cities under <unk>
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Tanzania, Honduras.
Did you know that every year around 75,000 <unk> will come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and make those same stuff in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> went through a constitutional crisis.
In the next presidential election, <unk> <unk> gave us a platform for a platform where promised reforms and at the same time.
He asked <unk> he was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of standards, like those rules that say you can't go and meet all the current residents.
And so we had a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like <unk> norms for <unk> and usually they are the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala was sent to <unk> a link with the TEDTalk.
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than its cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City, which in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> Talk.
And the talk was described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me -- and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, and we have to start with a site that was at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everybody <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, <unk> <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed me the TEDTalk.
And this explained to you that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that they could go could be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North.
And they also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need help from countries -- they could benefit from the countries associated with the countries that would help them establish and make the rules of <unk> so that they could all trust that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw one site.
This picture is from there.
It could easily take a thousand square miles.
And little later, the 19 of January, voted on Congress to <unk> her Constitution and add a constitutional disposal that could allow these special regions of development.
In a country that I had just gone through this <unk> crisis, on Congress in favor of this constitutional constitutional <unk>
All of the parties, all the <unk> in society, <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17th, it was passed over in another voting with <unk> to one.
So immediately after the voting at 24 to 24 of February, a <unk> <unk> was the two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in cities building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big New York City of the city that's building in Korea is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years getting the <unk>
The other country is interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're setting up a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and the time would allow the managers to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban <unk> cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you have already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are lots of companies that wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with an open-source zone, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change it immediately.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to go back to their family to get a job for work, sometimes they're mothers who have to earn the money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids are trying to meet with their parents that haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it seem to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends -- I was asked to say, "Thank TED <unk>
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a nice public confession -- which is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find up, and more recently, photograph and publish and post colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
My whole clothes is second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
I go to meet people who are normally going to a good <unk> My look is <unk> and buying into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what do I find today?
Being from my size?
I'm like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what we would think about for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings the whole <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought seven pairs of clothes inside, and nothing else.
You see it inside for a week that's all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I would like to use after coming here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know how the woman who walks for TED in inner underwear,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons that I believe that believe it or not, I've learned this journey of not using new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger here.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including the <unk> It took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- you don't just tell you, they will also give you."
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're inside.
Sometimes people tell me that they seem to play the <unk> or I remind you for their <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you're not good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the age of 30 years that really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your inner and outside, you don't see you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth for you: The golden <unk> are going with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a very cool style of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and over again when people came up to me this week just for what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to go back certain things.
I don't need emotionally <unk> to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy <unk> colorful <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be a completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you look at your brain at this scale?
Some of them are <unk> for one of these ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually exclusive.
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just as most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put up with them and then we see it as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that they may have developed over the years is the one that says that one thing can be just in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, and it was always <unk>
But I bet you play with that bar of a parking bar I showed him a valuable lesson, and it is that the big things will not allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, and they don't play with these <unk> they play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
And at that point there was the physics of a few years gone, you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects around us every day.
That's not really good at my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, no one saw a <unk>
But it's not very good at my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of <unk> <unk>
I don't find the reason why it doesn't have.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been on an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then here we do a good approach to the small metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of a metal piece of metal, with a form of springboard and that shows up on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip. And I started to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in the form of swimming <unk> which is found underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it it needs a bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up with me to do those things, because I don't want to get them to, or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The companions on the journey of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that they <unk> and the wind that passes on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little metal piece of metal to <unk> according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights then we introduced a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then we took it down to a temperature of less than absolute zero.
Now, by being just in the <unk> the small piece of metal is free to act as wants.
So we measure their movements.
We discovered that he moved in very strange ways.
Rather than staying perfectly still, and it was <unk> and the way it was <unk> it was like a breathing in this way -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And when we give it a soft, we were able to make it <unk> and you don't get at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's only in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> is a clean room in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, watch this, the difference on the scale between one atom and that piece of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that metal and you.
So if one only atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why don't you <unk>
I mean, it's my logic of the <unk>
So imagine if you were in various places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And this is when we put it up, and we turned the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics -- it claims everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so <unk>
It's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections around all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my chief who's here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months.
So a lot of negotiations and stories, they have done it with 17 very interesting museum in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is explaining just about this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
I had a lot of education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better than it shows the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've taken from their launch.
So let's start <unk>
Look around all the museums that are there.
There's the gallery <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite ones, the <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do that -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that really doesn't matter.
You move around and get it away.
You want to navigate the <unk>
We open the top, and with one click, we jump inside.
You're inside, that you want to go at the end of the hall,
So just go forward. Which is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the sign of <unk>
If the museum shows you the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on this right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10 million <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get to 10 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get to 10 million <unk>
You can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to do it?
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems to be <unk>
I went back and discovered that children were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a stick with a stick on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper to even further and you'll see that you really can even get the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the image, you can really see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best is to come, a second.
So now let's quickly jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk> <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how recently van Gogh actually created this piece of work.
It goes up and it really goes up and really do it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another of my favorite features here.
There are lots of things over here, but I don't have <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online to create your own museum, to create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we come up -- I created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just made a zooming around.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Portrait Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at contemplating these works of <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium makes justice to your artwork and which is represented properly online.
And the big question that I'm doing today is, "You have done this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good morning everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a <unk>
In our lab, we call it technical design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, all the kids in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of their bedroom. But the reason I'm showing you this is that something really interesting has happened in <unk> careers one in the last two decades.
Some time ago, if you wanted to win a career of <unk> one, take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the career.
This is what in engineering, it has been <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting computers out of the air.
And as <unk> they're starting to respond in a different way, and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As you can tell, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet's cortex but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the <unk> consumption and up to 80 percent of the CO2.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the purposes of MoMA, during the <unk>
It's called <unk> Uncle <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all the atoms that are existing and they were <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> it tells you that at the end of the hammer and he threw it down into the Moses -- you can still see a little <unk> a <unk> and said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and run something.
Let's start with the detection of the detection with the detection of the detection with the detection of the detection of the detection with the beginning.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer with luck 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup year.
Maybe some of you remember it, they would play Italy and France, and at the end of the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, he won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day looking at the <unk> activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the River <unk>
It's the morning, before I play.
The time line is on the top.
At the late afternoon, there are people here and there are <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
You know, people do a quick call it goes to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First of the time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
Make Italy, yeah!
That night they were all going to go to the center.
There you see the great summit there.
The next day, everyone was at the center of the <unk> team and the prime minister of then.
And then the whole world is <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the age of <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> it's not about people, but things we use and use.
Today, we know all about the side of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a Mac, how it is <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year to tag on what were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all of all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one <unk> to the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information, we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on things that are complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> it doesn't exist, it's still somewhere in the planet.
That if the plastic bottle we dropped a day still there.
And if we can show people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detecting and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talk about at the beginning, which is push over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of water in public spaces.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, put to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine that they have a <unk> and you put rid of <unk> <unk> tubes.
It creates like a curtain of water, with water pixels with water.
If the pixels on the pixels can be written on them, show patterns, images, texts.
And then when the curtain is going to open up so that we could pass, as you see in the image.
We presented this by mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And it was a commission to design the building to the entrance to the <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no doors and no windows, but when you get close to it you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you get down the roof.
Or you can close the building and the whole architecture is disappears, like this case.
Those days there will be somebody, in the winter, when you go down the roof, somebody who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture goes away.
This is working.
You see the people who are going on in the inside.
And here I am myself trying to do not <unk> when the sensors open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the kids in <unk> came to the building, because the way they interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you come up, but a building that kept making <unk> and water holes and you had to jump to not wet.
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how people will give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air, and that each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves into space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw earlier, moving with others in sync.
We could form this cloud, right?
So a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal display in two dimensions.
Or a normal thing, but in three dimensions, what changes is light, not the position of the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can close to it, and look at it from very diverse <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When you turn the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best celebrity dancers today, the star of the New York City of New York City and <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> <unk>
It's so much <unk> it is in real time <unk>
It can turn all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment as a farm farm -- like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
So imagine that we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what remarkable has happened in the last two years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've seen everything like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign we can go through the digital world of the <unk> of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change, or CO2 emissions. How do we go from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can get people involved in doing this together in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made from pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in <unk>
You can move inside, you have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to be able to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics of 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a way of connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can enter there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are they?
Suppose I told you that, with only some changes in your genes, they could improve the <unk> by more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, to be stronger to get more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure themselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe they are in those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What are you most excited about.
What would you do that, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people would choose creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> Probably to the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you choose <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just imagination?
Or maybe this is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED conference but today I want to give you a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which was also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a trial called "Nothing in biology -- makes sense of the light of <unk>
But if you actually embrace biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
Is it about other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, is of course, the most interest of us.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
There have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of apes.
Some of them have been and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, <unk> <unk> that comes out of <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take in the gut more bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> gives you the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully controversial environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that can want no effort to be able to be <unk>
It's really like a quick way for the bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush to the <unk>
But so we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrient nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what about the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single <unk> and only human life, a small note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I just went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental about most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, each cell is simply divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters of that cell <unk>
But when the organisms come in, things start to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the body death comes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year I was happening, I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night somebody hits your door to the hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of he finds a <unk> <unk> <unk>
He looks at it and says, <unk> looking for a <unk> <unk>
"It's okay. He says George, "I chose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily even different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to care healthy.
I wanted to bring health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution consists of changing the genome at the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are kind of like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think everyone would put together the feeling that Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily favors longevity.
They don't necessarily favors the greatest or the stronger or the faster or the faster and not even the most clever.
Evolution favors the best adapted creatures to their environment.
That's the only trial for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish are burning in the <unk> yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's going on in evolution and if we come back to think of the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward, to phase <unk> I would say there are lots of possibilities.
The first one is that you don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise have been <unk> and taken from the population.
And second of all, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be transferred to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we are so excited that it is no longer possible to have the isolation that evolution happened.
A second possibility is that a natural kind of traditional type of kind of natural type of nature.
And the argument here would be that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as much as the <unk> when as a species <unk> distant planets are going to exist, and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, and a possibility attractive and intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the choices that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we come to do this?
First of all, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society -- but it's what you pick up on the individual and family level.
Think of it also that if it could be able to choose not just the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make the genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminating it.
You wouldn't want to do those changes in their <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The following year of being finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a close cost at the 20,000 dollars.
They didn't make a lot so that the human genome is going to be actually the human genome for <unk> and to be more and more at all.
You come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect themselves but they are going to engage against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine against flu <unk> into a plant plant.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and in the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and <unk> or change the newborn egg and giving their children a better chance of a more healthy life, remove the diabetes, reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then that same <unk> technology, that same engine in the science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also adopt a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could get it to the next generation of the machine machine.
Why not have a faster <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we want to have turned the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take a hundred thousand years old, and we can go to 1,000 years, and maybe it happened within the next hundred years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or grandchildren are going to get to them.
We're going to use these choices for a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deeper of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom you need to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a huge explosion when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor by doing <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat in that day, I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight <unk>
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. You probably get some <unk>
The pilot already had <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot ran the airplane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not <unk>
It took the engines.
Imagine being on an airplane and without <unk>
And then three words said ...
The three more words I have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to come and didn't do it, all the length that I wanted to repair all the experiences that I want to do and never <unk>
While I was thinking later on, I was a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to hear anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the bridge George Washington, that I wasn't very much -- I thought about, "Wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity, it also gave place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that we were doing things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> on that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels about <unk>
I don't try to have <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is kind of like your mental watch is going to be <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And while I was born, I had the feeling of, "Wow, that is not afraid.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to love myself, I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --  --  And I scream, <unk> as a little boy.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point, I got to connect those two points, which is the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the ability to look at the future and come back and live in another way.
You are flying today, the challenge that you can imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please not be so -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is it that <unk> who still expect to do because they think they're going to live for <unk>
How do you change your relationships and the negative energy on them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents that we have.
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to his home after he ran and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today you have a total paralysis today.
You can only use your eyes.
Their work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation and animation, so obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with her brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "We just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second -- it's not that you see Stephen <unk> it's not that all the people with paralysis, can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're going to be someone important and have a good insurance can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Anybody see the film "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they are going marking with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I presented to me with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I engaged his brother and his father there at that particular time, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, and we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much inside your inner can't <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research Research -- which have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer that's actually draws on that and register the negative space.
So they're going around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that they <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They start with sex organs, then with the bad words, after the Bush and the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and much moving things on one side we had a couple of things.
One, I touch the gates of the insurance companies, and we got a machine to be able to build a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And really, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy -- you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was bring seven programmers from all over the world to get rid of every corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, kids and I, we moved to the back garage and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought that we were going to do something totally stupid and that when they were <unk> they would have taken off the frames of the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks <unk> we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk>
It's a pair of low-cost <unk> that we buy on the <unk> <unk> Beach, some of copper wire and Home <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a camera <unk> we put it up on a LED light, and now there's a device that's free -- and it builds up -- we published the code -- the software is low in the way free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that tells you.
There is no hospital that can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you so much for you.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening.
And after more than a planning year, two weeks of engineering sessions I am, Tony <unk> to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot outside the hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what I would say, "This was the first time I was in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and they would get me out there so that I could get <unk>
It's not <unk>
In some form that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in movement, developing.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
That's why we are trying to figure out how to go and make it faster and robust.
And since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong did something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really great.
The best of all of this -- and this is what ends up to close the <unk> is that April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> in downtown Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> in the urban art.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you look at something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of what there was in this room was possible -- stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain moment.
Do you know anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want we all to do every day when we will find something that we feel like to do. If it's not now, when? And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years, in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time a dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
Film in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just this -- a lot of fun in the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I have been <unk> in situations in horrible situations with the only goal to try to examine social issues in ways that we're going to create interesting, and hopefully measure them in a way that looked and accessible for the audience.
So when I knew I'd come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered to sell the rights of the name of 2011.
What there was was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that they have no idea what it is and according to content that you can do in your face, especially if I put it into ridiculous you or your company to do it.
But said this, it's a very good opportunity for me.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I couldn't tell you about certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing <unk>
And as I said before, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> for something that was so difficult or as dangerous as entering the room with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that is about the <unk> of products, the marketing and the advertising, and that the whole film would be <unk> with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all up at the bottom, at the end of the end, it has images to make it all the time; from the <unk> which appears before the title of the title of the title of the title, <unk>
Now this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> in the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is what? It's what? You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> It was just more for <unk>
He was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the signature of the X mark in the title but we're going to make sure they burn all the categories that we could in the film.
You may <unk> a shoe and becomes the most cool shoe that you've got to.
The most great car you have <unk> in "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink you have <unk> <unk> of "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing you brands as part of life, and make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> MS: And we actually showed the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is the transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That's the complete idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help us make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that. It's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how responsive people are going to be.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it's going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half -- <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard the meeting with them, but certainly going to be worth going to convince a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that we get out of the movie -- let's look at it as a lot of <unk> long.
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the responses will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> the film or be I?
JK: So both things.
MS: If you're not really optimistic.
So, I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where I go, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> was meant to have a conversation.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to so many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the stage of the media scenario is not the idea to tell that new vehicle that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this.
Actually no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this picture.
See, when you look for images of Google <unk> --  -- this is one of the first images that are introduced.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> free simulation of simulation or <unk> easily or <unk> <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access to information, above all in the <unk> practices, the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even the CEOs are <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it really changes very suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  Like that weird bear that's still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird road.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking with companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want them to be <unk> <unk>
We want you to give them a story, but that we want to be <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would tell me in some lie -- and there he is him looking at me, like, "Son, there are three sides in history.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's <unk>
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> from many years -- I realized that I would have to go on my own account, I would have to take out of the reserve and go to business myself.
So what I started to show you suddenly -- and what I started to realize is that when you start talking with business the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who do big, huge, giant giants and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make films of big Hollywood movies, they say the reason that their movies have so much success is because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these large, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to look specifically at <unk> in the film?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you to get you wrong.
Maybe you should have a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there he would offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for a man like <unk> <unk> to <unk> on <unk> whatever.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk> look.
Karen <unk> We're a small brand.
<unk> the smaller kind of films that we have -- we are rather a brand <unk>
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind people is the reason that this is what interests us.
MS: What words would they use to describe <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
KF: That's a great question.
Woman: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold right.
I think that <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category into positive versus the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you.
How do you keep ourselves cool over time? With better <unk> more than three times <unk>
Things like those that <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a company <unk>
What about me? What about a common kind of guy.
I need to talk to the man of the street, to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good <unk>
Woman: revive the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: Okay, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the color color, lots of gray colors and things like that.
Usually I'm wearing accessories like sunglasses, or <unk> and similar <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> Mercedes <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: They were partly partly <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: One, failed.
Is that anything?
<unk> I'm <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be brand Tom, but I often <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family picture.
A: a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to look at the world.
A: Tell me of that world.
MS: That world? I believe that your world is the world in which they are <unk> like the people around you, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case, and they start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk?
MS: The next is this was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things. I like weird things.
A: Tell me about <unk> for what does that mean?
What's the <unk> What is the <unk> What is the <unk>
Why is it important -- what is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more than you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) Thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. <unk> Great <unk> A: <unk> <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what you're going to get out of this.
There was a lot of crazy about this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two distinct sides -- but <unk> in your personality.
They were very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only going to fall in one of their strong points or the other rather than focus on both.
A lot of companies tend to do -- and it is nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid fear, those elements -- and you actually give them <unk> and make them become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is classical <unk>
And you can also see this to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and brands that have gone and come and come up, but a <unk> brand is something rather powerful.
MS: A brand <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to raise your identity to make your brand, your personality <unk> what would be?
Are you a <unk> you're somebody who makes your blood <unk>
Or are you more a <unk> <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> attributes are like being playful being cool as <unk> contemporary -- <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> fast, or <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystic <unk>
Or are you more of <unk> <unk>
You are conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're established, traditional <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're a <unk> stable, familiar, safe, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they would not have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how you now use magnetic resonance to identify the desire centers in the brain so much for commercial marketing like a movie.
We went to San Paulo where they have forbidden the air in the air.
In the city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> there's nothing.
And we went to school districts that companies are going to walk into the schools with money problems in the United States.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects I have had the greatest response or the ones that I've had more success is those ones that I've been dealing with with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took up their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone?
Well, since the movie was sent into the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just <unk> no press, no television.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It hasn't even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost all the agencies that we talk about is helping their customers not be part.
I've always believed that if you take a risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get to the people that are pushing it to the failure.
I think when you train their employees in loss of <unk> it's preparing all their company for <unk> of rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to us is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities that they can imagine.
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we need to give it the fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> the risk.
At one point, we have to embrace the peril.
And ultimately, we have to keep transparency.
More than not a little bit of honesty is going to run a long way.
And said this, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk -- <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So you know, <unk> in the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED organization at TED, the <unk> Foundation a check for <unk> to be applied to my attendance for next year.
And the idea behind the <unk> piece of <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can have a lot of problems with the centrifuge.
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus from Windows in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, then we are ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray, <unk> the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program, is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex at the part of the <unk> the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed like to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these systems systems.
So that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they went very odd things.
<unk> <unk> as a rat rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, and I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after I experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it is actually working on that place: in that place: too.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say for example, a U.S. energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack code, and we found that I was <unk> in two <unk> bombs and a big one.
We also saw that they were very <unk> very <unk> by people who obviously had all the internal information.
It will be all the points for them to attack.
You probably even know how much they would break the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and we were trying to engage with the real world, with potential real-world goals.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals about goals -- we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it has to be a valuable, <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because that's where most infections have been <unk>
You don't find several thousands of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear energy plant of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went back to an effort by <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the small digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly be <unk> and even making the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to do it slow and <unk> in an obvious way to go crazy to the nest engineers so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> on that code, you can't afford it.
I started looking at scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called steps.
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
It was almost <unk>
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in my hands.
It wasn't like this.
The results have been out after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> on dead ends.
Yet, we found that both digital <unk> were going to be able to go to one single and same goal, but from different <unk>
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that what is the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry that other goals are going to be <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw, I really got <unk>
There is the gray, and up the top, you see the <unk>
What this thing does is we intercept the input values of sensors for example, of the pressure sensors and the sensors of vibration and provides <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake data data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> to the operators of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbine is going down, you must open escape <unk>
Obviously, this can't do that a human operator can do.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can do bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And neither the <unk> or the security system is <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is really important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk>
It could be also, for example, in a energy plant, or in a automobile factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a key key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
They would make as much as possible.
And if you did that, with what you think about is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All green areas are a lot of targets.
We have to face the implications, and better than we start doing it now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done public in many sides that people assume that the <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, they really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower behind this.
There is one alone, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, otherwise our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can take you and give you some skill skills, or another one that makes wheelchair users get up and return to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
There are nothing different from something that gets in the morning, gives you a great force, which is also increasing its speed, and help you, for example, to handle balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate it and plug it with the universe and with other entities, that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started to talk about the American soldier who, on average, must take on their back a load of 45 pounds, and it's going to take you even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries in the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic abuse of the back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human Universal <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can put up 90 pounds of land for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run with a large <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my force and my <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of chairs on the wheelchair, about what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in chairs of <unk> around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens with a lot of very young people with damage to the column that when they start their life -- at the 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We are also talking about the population that is added up quickly.
Their only option, a lot of times -- by a brain injury or some <unk> -- is the <unk> wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, since its successful <unk> as I have to recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had an injury on the <unk> column and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> <unk>
It's got sensors ...
It completely <unk> in the crutches that send signals to the computer on board, here on the back.
There are also a little bit of batteries that give energy to the motors in the <unk> and in the knees, and they do it with this soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, for a stranger jump in the air, skiing down the <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all movement from <unk> down.
Shortly after that, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You never come back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last few moments of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs down to <unk> <unk> and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of chairs in the <unk> all of the <unk> all of the chairs of <unk> to all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival. Man festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos in the forests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest kin.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis on this aspect of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special, because this leads to a society that leads to a society that leads to a society, where violence has not been observed.
But unfortunately, bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it has been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict that has been <unk> and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction also put in danger of the Bonobo.
The hunting hunting trade and deforestation makes you not fill in or a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the laughter hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know how the apes <unk> the love, not the <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to manage conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the <unk> lives is more than the <unk> <unk>
When humans, like humans, love to play throughout their life.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
With him learn to <unk> and learn the rules of play.
Play increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of resilience, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the play game, you see the roots of the <unk> same as the laughter, the dance and the human bedroom.
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First of all, it's a baseball game, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "I have <unk>
I just believe that I love it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common in bonobos as in humans.
And this video really interesting is because you look at this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to play -- like the <unk> and also how play requires trust, and <unk> <unk> and at the same time is of the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is a young woman -- a young woman who is playing with <unk> water.
I think that, we sometimes play themselves, and we explore the limits of our interior and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form is the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that the Bonobo gives us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we need to adapt to a world more and more difficult for greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, play is our <unk> of adaptation.
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But let's give it the most of our ability to play.
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
By bonobos and humans alike, it's not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems at least appropriate to play, you can be the moments in which the most <unk>
So fellow primates, we will accept this gift of evolution and play together as <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting the poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of a captain in a <unk> volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers are going to a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high chance to go.
But there was still a career for the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what it was our task.
When I met <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, and she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and he was <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> --  was first to the captain and he asked her to walk into the dog of the house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There I was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people that I entered a building in flames to save a live alive because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need you to go home.
I need you to <unk> <unk> fire, and I bring this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected, but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the <unk> <unk> that at the end of that height or just ended up on the room in search of a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
We take away from the house, the <unk> for the house owner where, as it was expected, he got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department was able to get a letter from the house owner of <unk> to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was, someone had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling on Robin <unk> as in my calling as a volunteer firefighter is a witness to the acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also the individual acts and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have made them, or they are by <unk> remarkable levels of success -- I'd like to remind you this:
Don't wait for the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give me <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a <unk> park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's lives, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So I enter the <unk> <unk> shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem odd, but I am a big fan of the concrete block there.
The first concrete blocks of concrete was built in <unk> with a very simple idea, including cement modules from a fixed measure that fits together.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things larger than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, the <unk> came up with it.
It was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, <unk> bricks came to all home.
It's estimated that over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful buildings, buildings or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> piled on some other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the particular block block, the transistor allows to create much bigger and more complex, one brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't think about it that the building blocks of our time are reserved to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing engineers into the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they link through magnets.
So you can't be able to place it wrong.
The bricks have a colored code.
The green is, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color.
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits as well.
A blue one with a green one, make light.
We can put a button in the middle, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button through a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
So we would take this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> it allows us to program using <unk> <unk>
To make it <unk> faster or slower -- just turn this button to make the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an underwater collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world <unk> to brick ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given <unk> to kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start understanding the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light at night, or why the door of an elevator elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to the design schools.
So for example, designers without experience in electronics start to play with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago, we took the designers in Rhode Island School designers who don't have any experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, "Do you get something.
Here's an example of a project that you've done, an underwater canyon -- a movement.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> which is afraid of the dark.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can see the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So ahead and make it.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for involved with the environment focus on the environment.
collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video next to one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I've already been term.
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and work for a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that's supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work in the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> of Peace <unk>
We put a few members every year, and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They worked big <unk> worked with the employees of <unk>
Your task is to show the possibilities of technology today.
Meet <unk>
It's a <unk> from the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I would find a quote, but what you really look for is that somebody has to clean it when it stays <unk> because it knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered in a meter of snow.
How did it get help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at the time we spent very much last year.
Did you realize that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else -- that citizens were struggling with <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice app that you can adopt a <unk>
You embrace <unk>
And when you do that, you put a name, in this case, he put him <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can do it.
So it has a players' component.
It's a modest application.
It may be the smallest of the 21 <unk> applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads out.
A responsible for the City of the city of <unk> when I see this app that I could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people are stealing the batteries.
That's why they ask citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people used to clean up sidewalks when they were born.
So now we know nine cities that plan use it.
And this has spread out without <unk> in organic and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen yet.
The acquisition of software is usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then we were told that it was made by the normal channels would have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California that until the time has cost 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that shows up in a couple of days, and it spreads viral is a kind of shot of warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests to the better government ways to work, not like in private businesses, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but as well as the Internet itself.
I mean, <unk> in a open and <unk> way.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents a way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we're building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people across the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
Do you feel a lot of frustration at that, but they don't have it <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And that is that if we stop the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that are getting crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because it was not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to get it, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk>
And because the ultimate government ultimately goes out of us -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to pick people out to be able to be able to make it <unk>
Well, after two years, I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about <unk>
This is the center of services and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark it in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this phone call.
I joined <unk> at the basis of official knowledge.
I didn't find any.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, put music very hard and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So well by Scott.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has an app and web and mobile phone called <unk>
We don't have that application.
It was the work of people who were very clever about the Bureau of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happened is this <unk> <unk> in my garbage garbage -- I don't know if it's dead.
How do I make it <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I'd come back to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
Then I went home. I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical <unk>
And it's also a great example of government income to sustainable voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get sick and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
He connected the two people.
And it could be <unk> connected to government services, but our neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When one neighbor helps each other, it <unk> the communities.
If we call control of animals, it costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the input to the other.
Our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen to a leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government is going to raise our values and we need our needs but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the superficial layer of 15 <unk>
At the bottom is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> what keeps us that we have to do that that we funded as something that works against our <unk> that something else, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work to make the bureaucracy it is sexy.
Because that's where the real job of government works.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
You've got them <unk>
This is a bunch of citizen citizens that have written a very detailed report of 325 shots.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk>
And so for the ones that we have faced with government, it's time for us to ask, what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see huge challenges that they have to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we have to go out without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function so that it can expand to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not that difficult to act -- we only have to articulate systems in the right way.
The average age of the age of members is 28 years old, so I, to <unk> I'm a older generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who's going to <unk> they're all going to speak.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time.
So when you face the government problem doesn't really care about to hear your voices.
They're using your hands.
They make the work to program applications that make a better job for government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking away a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to have clean those hydrants and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not just consumers, we're not just consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask all of the people here, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in community communities and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED, watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things that I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are saying here have impact all over the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we have seen fantastic.
And I think we've learned that the words of a professor can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learned this in the practice of the law, my job.
I learned that from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional African-American house, dominated by a <unk> who was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, it had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way the world looked like.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was small and I looked at her, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then I was <unk>
One or two hours later, I came back to <unk> and I was saying, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I got back back and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that would always want to want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
On occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to catch his time and her attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up in the room and then they were running out of my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
At first I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at him and <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, I went through the room and said, "Come on my hand and said, "Come on. The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now you know, <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know I've been <unk>
And I think, "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I will never forget it.
And then he said to me, "Just want me to give me three things: <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do, is you always want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that I always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so I do."
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to do, is that you always are going to do the right thing -- although the right thing is <unk>
I thought that and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I'm going to do it."
And then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to do, is that you never have <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so I do."
I grew up in the field, in <unk> I have a brother a year older and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14, 15, one day my brother came home with a six <unk> <unk> I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and I went to the woods.
We can just get the <unk> of the <unk>
He took a drink of beer, he offered to my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> <unk> and you always do the same as us.
I took something, your sister as well. Take a <unk>
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked <unk>
And he said, "What's up? Take a <unk>
I went through my gaze and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying that it's a <unk> I mean by the power that has identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that they really don't see any sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't think they can do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My children died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that we had to, according to it, we had to <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago.
There were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there are 2.3 million.
In the United States, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in the parole.
And this massive incarceration in my opinion, has changed our world.
In poor communities, poor or <unk> it's so much <unk> so much despair.
One in three black holes between 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> around the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, County, Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all the young people are in jail or in parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty, than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that affects the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not problems.
We are <unk>
It looks interesting.
We're looking at our work with some good developments quite curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as in other states, they will give you rights, if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has lost definitely the right vote.
And if we put it over the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights will be as elevated as it was before it was before they <unk> the law of the right vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where it sentence to 13-year-old children die in prison.
We have in this country prison for kids, without any chance of coming in.
Right now, we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They went to people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, they have been thinking that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not trying to decide whether people deserve to die by crimes <unk> but if we deserve to kill them.
This is interesting.
The death penalty is defined by mistake.
In every nine <unk> people have identified one that is innocent and released from death row.
A rate of mistake, <unk> an innocent in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not allow you to never fly planes if every nine person would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue if we <unk> kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on history <unk> I talk about slavery.
I tell you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a kind of defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and tell me, "Mr. Stevenson, you will teach talks, <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, say, <unk> that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with <unk> and decades of <unk> and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic where we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we get to each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome the <unk> without a compromise with the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures on death penalty.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know that it's very disturbing to listen to what you might expect.
<unk> don't have death row in Germany.
We can never have it here."
The room was silent and a lady said, "There is no way with our history, we could never get into systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational than us, <unk> and <unk> were going to put us to run people."
Let's think about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We wouldn't make it <unk>
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these hard issues, the good things and wonderful things are, but yet <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by the suffering, the abuse, the <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both things.
Recently we talk about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ones that never come to TED.
If you think about it is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
The development of innovation, with creativity. The development is not just brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection from the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also in dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the big leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, which allows us to be truly human, if we don't pay care of poverty to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, in injustice.
Now I want to show you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity, than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a young lawyer who was a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> called me to me, <unk> comes the <unk>
Do you want to come and look at it.
I was like, "I know lady. "I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when I <unk>
I read it <unk>
So I was going to go and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Mrs. <unk> went to me and said, "Now, let me tell you what the idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end the <unk> of life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about death penalty.
We try to reduce the population in prison.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and I looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> got me on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to figure out how to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated with simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, is not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't <unk> it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills another, it's not a murderer.
So I think there is a basic dignity of people who should be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
It's not.
I really think that in many parts of the opposite of poverty is the justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> very spiritual -- we don't have to judge us for our technology, by our designs, not for our intellectual and rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not by the way they treat the rich powerful and <unk> but by the way as they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been convicted of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my customers from 13 and 14 years old, which have been <unk> so they were <unk> as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what it isn't is?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
And one night I was up to wake up <unk> my God, if the judge can turn you into something that you're not, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has <unk> powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think of correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a <unk> <unk> a small, poor, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my black client from 14 to be treated as a senior white <unk> of a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there had been anonymous behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had a <unk> but he had sent him to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to the court for this case stupid.
I got up to the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
And I finally went down from the car to sit at court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man <unk> was the <unk> of the court.
When he looked at me, and he said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's you. I said yes.
And then I got rid of me and <unk>
And I got sick in the ear, too.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected deeply with me with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into my audiences.
When you get in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> I was so."
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those crazy things.
They came the police, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people, and I'm all comfortable because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye of the eye I got to see the <unk> that I was going to go and look at it.
You would look out the window and try to hear all that <unk>
I kept walking over here and for there.
Finally, this old black man, with <unk> face in the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge had a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> he showed <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> on the old black <unk>
And he said, "What do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood on the <unk> looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> this room of audiences to tell this young man to keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I've come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds up to the justice.
That we can't be truly human, if we don't care about human rights, and for dignity.
Our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of the people who share this, I just want to tell you to keep your view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Talk to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help in your purpose of doing something.
Which is not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are multiple opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you're going to do an effort to fund the funds you spend today in policy policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the homicide cases was not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't come to anything.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law for security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, you say is it has to do with the largest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you that you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
This is why it arises in this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into the supply chain, by stealing a bicycle by small crimes against the property, rather than making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our philosophy today about punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: You know, you've got us excited about me today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- <unk> could be the last six days or for the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of our senses our senses get so much more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters to us more than survive, the first stop all of those data is an old fragment of the temporal lobe, called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning that the danger.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us hurt.
So this is why a <unk> of stories, looking at the negative.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there's blood, you know, it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news to the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be wrong in worse.
But maybe it doesn't.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we got <unk>
Perhaps the enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance over the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems with climate change, the <unk> of species, water and <unk> no doubts we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long run, we just ended up with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> per capita income has been <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
Moreover, the cost of food food, of transportation and communications and communications, has dropped 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles graffiti. The global literacy went from 25 percent over the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we keep getting higher and higher expectations.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, toilets, refrigerators television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> the planet would never have dreamed of such <unk>
So you know, a lot of this is the technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend by Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law -- and doubling the price of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- at good and bad times, in war and peace, in <unk> in depression and <unk>
It's the outcome of quick computers used to build faster.
It doesn't stop before the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And on this curve, to Moore's Law of Moore's Law -- there are extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have to tell us.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends from <unk> call infinite computing sensors and networks, and networks, 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production all over the planet, synthetic biology, fuel medicine, <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory in "Jeopardy" about Watson, <unk>
It was <unk>
I sought in the newspapers the best headline to <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
<unk> with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence on the cloud, available for all on your phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year, we asked them to release a company, or a service or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> <unk>
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that stuff that's scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story about Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The troops from Napoleon ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the <unk> king ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most precious metal on the planet, it was more than gold and <unk>
For that reason, the tip of the course of Washington is <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like <unk>
It's tied for oxygen and <unk>
But then it got the <unk> and made it something so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
And we would bring this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about energy energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that has per 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 percent of energy <unk>
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated generated by <unk> <unk> versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the United States parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour, compared to the 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have water abundance too.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
You remember when Carl Sagan pointed like the Voyager spacecraft to Earth, in 1990, after he passed <unk>
I put a very famous picture of how it was <unk>
"A pale <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> on the planet, but there's a hope.
It's a technology available in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators of the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a small hole.
It is able to generate a thousand gallons of drinking water on the day of any water <unk> water or a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
And the president of Coca-Cola has just thought that a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that you will be, Coca-Cola actually implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an amazing innovation for this technology that it exists.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
And we knew that original warrior has better mobile communications in Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell a smart mobile phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
And better than that, the things that you and I have paid for dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars called <unk> video, libraries of books and music, <unk> technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe you get the best thing to get in the health of the health line.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce the <unk> Foundation, which is something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we have to deal with these technologies in a mobile device that they talk, and because it has <unk> can be extracted from your finger <unk>
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the world in the developing world that there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health workers.
So when this device <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that we don't want to call the health agency, and first of all, they will prevent the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it a billion increasing.
The white lines here are the population.
We've just changed the mark of the seven billion.
By the way, the better protection against demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds never before <unk> that add to global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you say? What <unk> <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with Khan Academy -- because of the use of 3D impressions and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we deliver three million more members of mankind, healthy and <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
What if we give them <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What do you do?
And if these are contributions that we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X Prize, which is that young teams guided by their passion with a clear goal, and they can do things like <unk> things that could only do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that might have heard of them.
It's called <unk>
Let's focus at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out the way the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the <unk>
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with these professors -- university professors, each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined together, and they started <unk>
And it has been shown today that the recognition machinery of human patterns is better -- we have better <unk> proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovative <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three million new minds that are going to be excited to work on the solution of the great challenges and to do what we should do.
We have a few extraordinary decades in front decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very cool idea.
The <unk> of the point of departure.
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before you give them three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that I was <unk> but it didn't.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> of the <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, over the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they keep <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot to the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from a mangroves.
There was <unk> from about 20 percent, a black beard, <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and it was going for a good moment, so it was made over the middle in Ghana.
When I went 27 years later, the number of fish had gone down in half.
I went back to the <unk>
It was a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fishing fishery in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in the <unk> Europe did a lot of development.
The fishing development was meant to impose countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad -- he was called the <unk>
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the south of China and <unk> and above all, in the Beaufort Sea.
What we stood there was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the bottom.
And most of the fish are blobs are blobs of about some of the remains of the coral reefs.
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then it starts commercial fisheries.
The bottom line is going to be a solid background of soft coral in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
I didn't hear them. They were <unk> because they were dead.
Once we had a living time.
I was still not <unk>
And then they wanted to take it because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect every time you go to an area where they've never fish.
But it wasn't <unk>
We don't remember the world, but we don't remember it.
We took the start to start a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> <unk> the water supply -- the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation uses the images that I started at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the piece of changes.
And at the end of the end, I keep a few <unk> remains.
And that, in large measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they are, they are no longer what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies kill them, kill animals without knowing what they've done to about generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is unusual.
You don't lose animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a big sea for big fish.
They become little frequent because the <unk>
Over time there are few fish, but we think that's the point of departure.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way is not the way they would expect to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of us who have as captain as captain and maybe looked at a lot of fish in this area can't be used or, usually they don't use the scientists of fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, but we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources.
From the enormous role that it can fulfill a protected marine zone.
Because with the marine protected areas, we really <unk> the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has been run and very low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected protected area and can benefit from the vision that you want to, which allows them to erase their point of departure.
And what about people who can't do that because they don't have access, like people in the Middle East.
I think there are the arts and cinema maybe you fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales on the <unk> Bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the film -- they were talking about the story of <unk> why would you be able to do it with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a certain sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that giving, is Cameron, I would make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
So what we're going to see today is why the videos are doing viral and what importance has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- when I was younger, that it seemed very, very hard.
But today the website makes any of us, or our actions, copper signs in a part of our world culture.
Anybody can have been famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They go up over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, only a small percentage gets lots and lots of visits and wins and cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: I say these trends, and three things: <unk> and factor.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God.
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this film outside in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views of the past last summer.
<unk> didn't say to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published a lot of videos from nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that we took to the video to the <unk>
The trends like Jimmy <unk> present new things and interesting things to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start on a Friday.   You all want to get the weekend out of a week, the weekend of a week.      I won't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I won't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come from nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday country.
Well, it took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science Science -- was one of the first people to make a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of trends takes a point of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this great internal joke then starts talking about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 21st-century entertainment of the 20th century, this communal engagement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year they saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that this is weird to know that there's a three hours version that has been seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that you saw other cats seeing the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that awakened between the Internet <unk>
There was <unk>
Somebody made an old version of the old one.
And then it became international <unk>
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> which made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all become part of.
Because today not only <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca Black or <unk> <unk>
What do you script could have written this situation?
In a world where two days of video go up two days of video for minute, just the only thing and unexpected can make it the way these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against <unk> in New York, I admit that I wasn't very interested in me.
Casey <unk> I <unk> me by the <unk> but there are often obstacles that are circular to get the <unk>
KA: Thank you to the effect of the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million and understood his idea.
So this approach is worth doing everything new we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads us to a great <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The trend of creative communities of participation, the completely unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media -- of a new culture, that we all have access and is the audience that defines <unk>
As I said before, one of the world's celebrity in the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Don't be allowed to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners from our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media characteristics -- they're just the current media -- but it <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit of unit and freedom from her country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
So the words, for so long -- friends, I think about it.
It was <unk>
He died <unk> by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never knew.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to come back, but I did it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> miles into the sea.
My mother, <unk> had only 18 years when his father died, and marriage marriage and two small girls.
For her, life was destined to be given the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her who couldn't do that.
And after a four-year <unk> that defies fiction fiction, a boat were curious to the sea as dressed by <unk>
All of the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the tent, the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother had a <unk> <unk>
If we were <unk> first we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the engine, <unk> <unk> in each wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the pirates that came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the operating platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, to finish the journey was too much for it; and the first apple that I did, given by the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
And after three months in a refugee camp, it <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb class suburb -- whose population is composed of heights.
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the rights.
The odor that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the <unk> English fragments were <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a assembly line, working six days, <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a degree in IT <unk> from the <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and they established an extra mentoring in English and math, wouldn't you mind what was supposed to do, which was usually <unk>
Two pairs of middle school for school, you will hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because it had to last six years.
And there were rare <unk> and <unk> about <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back home."
At home, where?
One thing was <unk>
He was accumulating and determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was opening up every night, but we would get rid of our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother suffered all the ship.
And my task was to be wakes up until his nightmares -- they started to be able to make it happen.
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and it opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make their transition angry and angry and <unk> boys were trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> classic <unk> with what I was going to take for myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives -- tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many people were helping over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year, I was given the young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of not <unk>
As <unk> resident <unk> I was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk to the sites I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence was never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about nothing.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of every single one and he ran down the three still in the bed.
And I told my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we get the ship.
He never had been an option.
<unk> told me, "and don't be what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking about, the more it was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the roads in life, a lot of them doing what they were going to live on on the border of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a career race.
There must be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's well going to be an unknown new <unk> new in the scene -- and not only it's fine, but it's something that will be grateful, for perhaps a ship.
Because being inside can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
And I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone, to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, a <unk> mixture of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
<unk> a small group of people for the people who can't <unk> it was an challenging challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, it made a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
They were going to go back to the night at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some bright ones, and we open up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after a single journey.
My <unk>
Three months later, I was <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared about.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother raised itself.
At 17 became <unk> from a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support of her husband, he caused a <unk> to <unk> and to take the cause of it, and much more <unk> caused when he won.
<unk> can prove to be wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel in a hotel in <unk> when she died.
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and watched the other side of the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell him stories and made sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> her hand.
I asked her to <unk> "Why is his hand hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life we were in our way now we can see that the men that would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have been very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that to know?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave on each wave, the constant pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could take it and see them safe, I would do.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is now in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky.
We were having a conversation with how nothing has changed since the age of ancient <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplane.
At that time, when I was <unk> the great Indian warrior would <unk> I had <unk> he took a bow and a <unk> on the floor, he could get water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we got was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was very excited.
Every time I felt a little bit more about <unk>
I would give me this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic, not to kill her.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece of technology of 50 years was to my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones -- the luxury clocks and the cameras are prevents <unk>
We have our inspiration.
So I was telling me to get me to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than kill her.
I read books for the age of 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a narrative device that will connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book, you can know how to take the book, you can know how we take the book, you know?
Where we are.
Put the text with the image, music, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what does that mean?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so --  He says, "This box belongs to me, write my name.
And so I come back a character from the book.
In several moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through the GPS -- that comes led to me.
So my inner girl are excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that magic of childhood and those ideas that we <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a bottle. I always became exciting.
So over here, we have to get the iPad to release fireflies.
And they really light your way into what you see from the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by girl was that a whole galaxy would come into a <unk>
So here, every book and every world turns into a <unk> that I move into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In all of a fantasy book, there has always been maps but has been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect of me is to create Indian content, and it's a contemporary thing.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of fairies and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the camera cameras for millennia, in an old <unk> book.
That's why we're bringing them back into a childhood story.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the world's problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they have not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that we have to go out on the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason the children don't do it.
So to reclaim this childhood ritual that we have to go out and, in a chapter, we would get a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex, and then you go back to it.
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
An London boy puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Inside the variants of the connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book we had an interaction where you get out of the iPad and video on and by using <unk> reality sees a group of cartoons that appear about the interior plants.
And at a moment, the screen is full of <unk>
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are attributed to technology and magic and technology can come to each other.
It provides the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic magic and love love we sat together through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to an listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk> What do you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what everyone, or maybe not all, but most of the <unk> projects are failing, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi <unk> It's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> <unk>
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I get rid of my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem of weight is not at the same time that I need <unk> or some urge you know, but you see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have over 4,000 followers, on Twitter.
So every morning, I connect to my <unk> Wi-Fi and before I got up my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best that it can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also so that patients quit smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some activity in order to have more control of their health.
The next week is going to be available for the next week.
This little <unk> is connected to an iPhone or another device.
And the people who are <unk> from their houses, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor and share it with each other, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, come back to <unk> and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us health care because of the challenges that we face, the firing costs of attention -- the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share with you with a video with you.
We all have navigation controls in <unk>
Maybe we even get them on our phones.
We know perfectly where ATM machines are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked them, but no one will <unk>
Nobody knew where to get <unk> saves lives right now.
So what we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please see <unk> where, and when it's open, because it's because sometimes you open up in <unk> <unk> and others are closed.
And more than 10,000 <unk> are already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use their phone from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we wish we were going to go globally.
We're <unk> to all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, so that we will help us find and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us express these <unk>
They might be <unk> or people of <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in their place.
Please go into this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk>
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's photographs that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed together with my <unk> <unk> but it was a little bit different because when I use the camera the process was in the planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera and the process ends up when you get the <unk>
For me photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed that anyone could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the <unk>
<unk> like this one, one construction on a very <unk> road.
But it has a unexpected.
And despite that, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures of you as dark and dark <unk> once but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want it to be captured in some way like photography.
And so you will have to think of a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it look real?
It's the details or <unk>
<unk> light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is a perspective.
But in the end, it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think it's realistic.
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly dramatic objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined, in a way, you can create something that still seems like <unk> as if it was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's look at the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make it look like a photo seem realistic -- I think they're those ones that we don't even want to even understand the things that surround us in our daily lives.
But by combining photographs is very important to <unk> because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the pictures are combined to have the same kind of light.
And these two images are dealing with these <unk> were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make us impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of photographs of different places.
In personal staff, I think it's easier to create a place that you find because you don't need to put in danger of the ideas that you have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are from a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a pump of rock.
And yes, I even made red the top of the island of the island to look more <unk>
So to make a realistic result of a realistic result. I think lack of planning.
You always start with a sketch, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here each piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures that you can take the result can be very beautiful, and it can be very beautiful.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide on a very boring slide.
Please if you can <unk>
This is a diagram that I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not interested in so much to show you the details but the general look like.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of microprocessors <unk> versus the power of the local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is a kind of straight line on scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude at the scale of performance.
Talk about technology with curves, and it's a new thing.
Here's something strange here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn on the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we have technological curves on scales scales.
The answer is that if you draw it into a normal curve that, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to give you -- the diagram would look something ridiculous.
That would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very silly. We would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation technology is as fast as the <unk> last morning we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go down to that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development that every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- looking at these <unk> curves, we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
You have one of two things.
Or is it going to be a typical curve. I know like this until something completely different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, and I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what it used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, what is that new way you adopt the world?
Where new state is going.
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel like something is going on.
We can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different that we extrapolate from what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
And so I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So we go back about two and a half billion years ago when the Earth was a great <unk> rock with lots of chemicals that are going around around.
If we look at the way those chemicals organized we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is, at that time, there was about oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil drops had a particular combination of chemicals that made them to incorporate materials out of the outside, and so the drops grew up grew up.
And they started to split.
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell forms, those <unk> of oil.
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each of them had a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> they <unk> a chemical distribution of the chemicals that we have.
So each droplet was a little bit different.
In fact, the droplets that would somehow be used to be better at the time of putting the chemicals together -- they grew more, and more chemicals and <unk> more.
Mostly, they lived over time, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, new chemistry, very simple, but things become interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell -- in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without meaning, a system of writing that allowed them to record what they were to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it was two and a half billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white powder that I try to hide the security people.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and put it 10 to the 22 times.
So if you want a hundred million copies of my personal card. I have a lot for all of the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> he would have put it into a virus and would have taken it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
And the DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy another billion years ago.
But then another big step in which things were very interesting in which things became very different and was that these cells started to swap and communicate information to that cell cell cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, they evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way of avoiding penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities who, in a way, were together in a way, and established a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or that if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community to become more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point occurred when these communities came back so much, that in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe for the community board into a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took over another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities <unk> communities from many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells who don't act lonely.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or your muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and become more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened in these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make information in the community.
It's the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the appliances that process the information that these mobile cell communities are.
In fact, they started <unk> inside the community as the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time period of time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruits because he knew bad and sick the last time they ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism since they had built these structures processing structures that evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built those structures from information effectively accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an amazing invention.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea in the head.
I'm sitting here emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in your heads that saves some analogy with mine.
But we take something really complicated and we make it sound, into sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we have started to do abstractions.
We now go through periods of similar periods of organisms -- <unk> our recording methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer tape -- the video tape -- the <unk> and so on.
And that aggregate us into something much bigger and faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen at <unk>
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> evolutionary <unk> where there was some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of history that I told you to give a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The remaining language, and so on, took less than a million years.
And increasingly, as electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess it's the right word to name something that speeds up its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make a living.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me, <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that I didn't did, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using recently, is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequence of instructions from <unk>
You could run these random instructions at random, taking all those programs, and take those that more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are closer to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
Let's get those and put them around the rest.
And now they <unk> the ones that I better ordered the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of both kinds of programs.
So we got a new generation of <unk> programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
We put some mutations in.
And it tries again and tries again to go back to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or sort of complicated, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that are going to be talking about absolutely perfect numbers.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell how they work.
I've tried to analyze it to see how they work.
They're dark programs. strangers.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I have the security that they get out of the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that could do it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
Once I was in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he goes, "Look at this.
He says, "Do you have hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a <unk> flight -- doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes very different.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
But we don't understand all the choices that they are.
It is in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make a lot faster computers and so I can run these programs much faster than it is very quickly.
I mean, it was <unk>
The thing goes and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we are at a analog moment of <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant in our part to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is.
But now it comes lunch and I think that I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time for me to give you a part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end of the end, the World Wide country.
We love baseball, right?
baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because it's going to come out, the <unk> talks about the statistics and to use it to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope a lot of you have heard of it.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300 from a <unk> that we have been given.
That means that the bat <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball to the game of the game without being <unk> and anyone who is trying to get it to the first base, it doesn't get to time, and the second foundation will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone from 10 car, <unk> four.
<unk> like the <unk> Ted Williams, the last player at the Mayor of <unk> in running more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now I think about this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable, or maybe less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're bound to a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and a dear to be dear to two clogged <unk> and their family doctor goes back to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 percent.
But you know what?
She's actually getting a lot better.
And the hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask:
What do you think is the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or a <unk> or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, great.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is <unk> the world, and I would include the <unk> <unk>
I never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student.
Once, a fellow in high school said Brian Goldman <unk> to a blood test.
Maybe which.
<unk> in my little <unk> at the home of <unk> at General Hospital in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my kind of <unk> <unk> the origin and the <unk> of every artery that comes out of <unk> the frequent <unk> of differential differential -- frequent <unk> and <unk>
And even knew the differential diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was going to go very well. I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the school of medicine with the impression that if you will, everything, then it would know everything -- or as possible, close to everything, because I get rid of the errors.
And it worked for a while, until I met <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady into the emergency room where I worked.
At that point, I was assigned to the service service.
And when the emergency room asked a cardiologist to go to that patient.
And to tell the chief of residents.
When I saw <unk> lady was <unk>
I heard sound <unk>
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which was sent to me heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and, instead of putting the blood forward, the blood goes forward, the blood goes to our lungs, these are fed by blood, and that's why there's difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I read with.
I gave aspirin and medication to ease the pressure on your heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that it could get rid of liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes in the world.
He sent her home without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't get the phone and I did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, would have been able to bring information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to make constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send him home, I didn't even pay attention to a voice in my inner and say, <unk> it's not a good idea.
In fact, I was so unsure that until I asked the nurse that he gave to the lady <unk> <unk> who's okay if he goes to her <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to complete <unk> "Yes, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was that he signed the high and ambulance ambulance with the ambulance guys brought her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I went on with my work.
At the end of the day, I was trying to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home. So I did something I don't normally do normally, I do something I didn't do yet.
It went through the emergency emergency service to home.
And there another nurse, not the <unk> of the lady <unk> before, but another one told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency emergency doctors.
Other specialists fear fear too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk>
"Well, remember the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
"Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
As an hour at the time he came to his house, after I would give him the high collapse and he had a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> they brought her to the emergency room with a <unk> pressure of <unk> which means a shock severe.
I just wanted to breathe and she was blue.
The emergency personnel <unk> all their resources.
They gave medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk> artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after <unk> was in intensive care and waiting for every hope that it was <unk>
And in the age of two or three days, it was clear that you never have <unk>
He had a permanent brain.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was going to be used to what was happening.
And the ninth day, he left her to go. Mrs. <unk> wife, <unk>
They say they never forget the names of the people who die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks ago, I was inspired by it and experienced for the first time the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture and sat alone, isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can't engage with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is that it makes us feel very bad inside.
It tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we are bad.
And that made it.
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I am sure that they were going to get things out and made sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he sent her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made I made a <unk> error.
Why do I choose <unk>
Soon that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on a day <unk> opened up the sky and finally went out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself where if you were to <unk> the efforts to be perfect for not to make more errors, would I cease to leave those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
It came back to happen.
Two years later, it was <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital north of Toronto, and I got a 25 man with a pain in your throat.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He sent him penicillin and sent him home.
But as he was headed to the door, he kept pointing out her throat.
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my chief chief asked to talk to me in his office.
And I made the three words: Does you remember you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can Google Google. It's an infection, not from the throat, but from the top, and that can cause the close to those tracks.
He <unk> <unk>
You can get antibiotics through antibiotics and recovered to the few days.
And I went through the same time of shame and <unk> and then I went back and went back to work, until over and over again and again.
Two times in the same emergency turn of the emergency shift -- not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, particularly working in a hospital, because they were brought to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought it had a <unk> calculus of them.
It was an X-ray X-ray -- but it turned out normal -- a colleague who was looking at the patient perceived to be looking at the bottom right, and he called a surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
And I read it liquid to <unk> and I asked my colleague that I did it.
I looked at it and when I saw some sensitivity in the bottom right quadrant, he called the surgeon.
Both were operated on and they recovered well.
But every single case, I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and like a lot of colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and not support.
And here's the problem: If I can't tell you and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I teach you this to not make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the errors of other doctors, but you're not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital was the wrong leg, I think I would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and those who don't sleep that they can't sleep and the ones that I know; they have <unk> results and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you do not have the people who make mistakes, we'll get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and liberal journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical <unk> and medical errors to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote to Toronto, and <unk> Black <unk> <unk> Black art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes happen every single day, where one in 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right -- in a system where reproductive infections are increasingly <unk> and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die of 400,000 <unk> by <unk> doctors die.
Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is divided every two or three years, and we don't have a lot of it.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in your chest, and he comes up with <unk> eyes, and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't make things the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't have their symptoms always the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like us, and we eliminate all the very likely professionals to mistake, you know, let no one.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their wildest cases.
In my <unk> <unk> white, art. art.
And their students were <unk> <unk> down the head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do that.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The medical doctor is human, you know human, they accept it, and not become proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the errors of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving and a loving mode of support for everybody else.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, we make mistakes of errors in it.
And I feel so much but I'm trying to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many choices we take a <unk> day.
You know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to pick an American American, are about 70 to day.
Not a lot, in a research followed for a week to a group of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of <unk> for these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> jobs for a week.
Naturally, every work included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Just 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think of your choices.
Do you know how many people belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do you figure out the way that manages those decisions?
So today, I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about potential solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When you ask a question, I am blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive, please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, you're ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
As a graduate student at Stanford University, I would have a very, very fancy supermarket at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a park park.
There was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of <unk> water -- and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that shop, but on one occasion, I asked myself, why never buy nothing?
This is the shelf in <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> <unk> who came from <unk>
I once decided I went to the manager and said, <unk> this strategy of offering all of these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists that they came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of classes.
I put a post to put it right into the shop.
We put up there in six <unk> or 24 tastes different and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop trying to try to try to try to try to try the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a <unk> that when there were only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk> of <unk>
So here we find the opposite effect.
The ones that stopped when there were only 24, only three percent got to buy <unk>
The ones that stood when there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> probably <unk> <unk> less is good to keep <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices will affect us in <unk> decisions.
We decided to not decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in which we look at the decisions about savings for retirement about a million Americans, in between 650 plans from this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funds available to savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program, to people saving for the future.
And we found that there was actually a <unk>
We had plans that went from two, to 59 options.
We found that the bigger the number of funds, there were less participation.
So if we look at the ends, we see that in the plans that they offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation went to the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more options, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for the ones that they decided to participate, the bigger the number of choices, more people will be used to avoid actions or hedge funds.
In how much more options, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts for market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences by offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing to do is that <unk> the decision, even when this goes against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively it gets better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that whole range of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for <unk> contrast and choosing that awesome <unk>
So today I want to show you to you with four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one form or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first one is, <unk>
You've been heard before, but it has never been more true than today, less is more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at is more and more is that if you choose to be able to get rid of <unk> options, you're going to be a sales, you know, the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> you saw 15 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> we eliminated all the products for the supply of cats that they were less <unk> they grew up <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and low costs.
You know that retail of today, on average is 45,000 products.
In a Wal-Mart store, they provide about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world today is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato tomato <unk>
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to manage the choices is the David <unk> <unk> the program at Harvard.
All the Harvard employees at Harvard are automatically <unk> to an insurance fund of life.
Those who are really willing to choose -- they give them 20 funding, not 300 or more.
You know that people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these are options <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> to make the differences that there are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they won't be able to make their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that it would be willing to offer people from this audience to a vacation for a few paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay.
Isn't that more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a little trick.
Who's ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
And in fact, you had more information in the first <unk> that in the second, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it to be more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the <unk> <unk>
So people understand the differences between options, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very <unk>
Why is people spending 15 percent of 30 percent more on average when you use debit cards or credit cards that when they use it seriously.
Because it doesn't seem to be real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
So that meeting exactly as it was <unk> we made a little <unk>
What we added was that we asked the staff that you would think of the positive things that they would be involved in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to place on their <unk> beads of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we made in a corridor of magazines.
We saw that in the supermarket <unk> along the <unk> corridor of journals can hold from <unk> different kinds to <unk>
But you know?
Because the rating tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know what?
This scheme is totally useless.
The categories have to indicate something that <unk> not that the <unk>
And you often see this problem with those huge fundraising.
I suppose who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity complexity.
It turns out that we can manage a lot more information than we think about if we just put it a little bit of it.
We need to increase complex complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a fine decision -- they buy it in a car.
This is a German car car that allows us to <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to put the car.
And these vary decisions.
<unk> color from the car -- I have 56 possibilities.
It was <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order in which the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, a few different boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go with a few options, four boxes, <unk> colors, lots of options.
And what about <unk>
How involved you are.
If you <unk> always the default button on each decision, it indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're being lost.
We found that the ones that go from a lot of options to work, <unk> the default button over and over again.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they're still there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order of information.
If we started the easy, you learn how to <unk>
So if you pick the box of changes don't say anything about the preferences of interior interior <unk> you can all make us a choice.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more engaged in the process.
To sum up.
So I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the overload of your food overload -- we will be able to eliminate <unk> alternatives -- <unk> <unk> <unk> can we handle more categories of <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented to you were designed to help manage <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who are going to work.
So I think that the key to getting the best of one choice is to be careful the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1990s, in the East East Germany, I <unk> if you had a writing machine should be used to the government.
I had to record a sheet of text of example written with the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message, you could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, how much that this is going to give the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer, any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer and it prints a page, that page will end up having a few yellow print on every page that you do from one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems to be very much about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world, we can put together the attacks on its <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
Your mobile phone <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to earn a lot of money, huge amounts of them.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that would raise money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys make their fortunes online, but they do it by illegal media by <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the <unk> account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know his <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us are a victim of a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going from wrong with worse.
In the future, most crime crimes in the line.
The second group of <unk> we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, you will motivate them the protests, they motivate them to hate laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do for money, <unk> like Anonymous that they do to protest and the last group are the United States and the governments that we <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an asteroid authority from the Netherlands -- or, actually, it was.
<unk> the ultimate fall due to a <unk>
<unk> the security of the site and <unk> a <unk>
I asked last week, I asked one of the Dutch government, I asked one of the leaders if they were born, <unk> death of people because of the attack on <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a attack of these?
<unk> is an integrated authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do they serve them?
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services with <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign authority.
And that <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the protesters <unk> the headquarters of the secret police police in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that manila folder, there were notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a big scale into the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 5,000 euros to the government <unk>
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments give us tools for governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this themselves.
For example, in Germany, only a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> by the government of the German government to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious of a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
The Internet connection to the Internet.
We can even be tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all of communication, and listen to online online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be, "Well, it looks like a bad thing, but it really doesn't affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do we <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's play privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could be trust in our governments today, in 2011, whatever right that we're going to do today, it will be forever.
<unk> blindly in any future government, in a management that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must be worried about the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the south of Yellowstone National Park.
These are the cows of my dad in the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like the <unk> migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, they follow them and this is what they do.
We <unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed by the night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and found it dead that I was dead because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we believe we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to get them off, and so we value them.
So I grew up with a lot of <unk>
They were dying are a warriors that protect our community and livestock and are also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A kid in my community, in the age of six to nine years, is responsible for livestock of his father and this was the same thing to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were scared.
But I realized that this was actually not <unk> because even helping the lions see the pen <unk>
I didn't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick the lions so they believed that he was near the <unk>
But male lions are very smart --  they came up with the first day and saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So you jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come from.
I discovered that the lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on the road to turn off the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a flashlight <unk>
They got everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery goes down to the small box -- I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> are <unk> because that's where lions.
And that's how you see the lions when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never went back to having trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses were heard of the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals that were killed and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
The <unk> You can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot of them.
And my idea is also being used by all of Kenya, to scare other predators, like <unk> <unk> and it's also being used to breed elephants from farms.
Thank you to this <unk> I was fortunate enough to get a grant in one of the best training schools of Kenya, <unk> School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> my father, and he used to see planes fly, and he said that one day would be inside of you.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer, of aviation and pilot when I was born.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving my father and my dad and the lions, can we be with lions without a conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting you can hear a story like yours.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working in other electrical <unk>
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention -- I want to do a close electrical -- CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know they already invented electric <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: You know, I'm going to give you one time, right, right, and <unk> <unk> I have tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: The <unk> Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to take it on every step that you would call friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk> nothing."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned much of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed <unk>
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public play.
But I thought that my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and myself had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When I did this, the five members of the family will stop there are going to be in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
It was very <unk>
I was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time, when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child in her arms watching his mother and she didn't be able to do anything.
No one would <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine will <unk> North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during starvation and just a few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more prevalent the energy cuts -- all of me was completely dark at the night except for sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> river which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But a lot of them die.
Sometimes it looked at bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with <unk> kin.
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as a refugee camp.
But I quickly learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also because the North North refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination, back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested for the Chinese police and went back to the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me many questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart would exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer said to another, "This is a fake report she is not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking at asylum.
But a lot of them can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although the <unk> had eventually released after an international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and sentenced to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of their world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided I decided to be risky going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I was hoping for.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and south.
We're all <unk> but inside, we have become very different from 67 years of <unk>
It even went through a crisis of identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call with pride with me.
Although I went to life in South Korea wasn't easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the exam test to college.
Just when I was starting to go back to my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had some money that sent my family sent to my family, and because my family was going to be shifted to force to the force in the <unk>
They had to run away.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way towards freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and walked to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to do it in a way, for over 3,000 miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and approached by a Chinese police officer.
And he asked asking them all of us and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese official came up to my family, she was standing up and I told him that they were <unk> who was <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I did.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated by crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything for free my family, and we were so close to me, but my family was <unk> in prison about the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to go and came out between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man wondering, "What is the problem?"
I was so struck that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM -- and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and to get them to get them in prison.
I took it up with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why did I make it <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of <unk> <unk> a new hope for me and for the <unk> village, when I was more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the <unk> people needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But getting freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice language practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us still keep in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans, an international support opportunity.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans, all over the world, including the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South dollars.
This is <unk> <unk> stores fast food, fast terrain.
And so the planners of the city came together and they thought, we're going to change the South South order to represent something else, so they changed the South Los Angeles as if this is <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles --  <unk> of <unk> food, dry <unk>
Just like <unk> million other Americans, live in a food supply, Los Angeles <unk> home to the places of food to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to take more people than food in the car.
People are dying of heart diseases in Los Angeles Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, Beverly <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I emphasize that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you get out of home, you see the effects of the current food system that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see chairs in <unk> wheels and sold like cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
I got tired of riding 45 minutes and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a strip of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 feet by <unk>
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me, because this is my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, the <unk> Green <unk> we put together and we started planting our food forest -- trees -- you know, the nine full <unk>
What we do -- we are a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> compound from the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone would be <unk>
The city looked at me on top of it, and I was given a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> became <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
<unk> <unk> food in a piece of land that nobody <unk>  So he was like, "Well, let's take it out.
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. had the written story by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more underground terrain.
It has <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's the equivalent of 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space for plant <unk> millions of <unk> plants.
Why on Earth does not seem good about this?
<unk> a plant to give about 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar a <unk> will give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
You get your own food that's like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South dollars.
I grew up there. I got my kids there.
I would dare be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to get my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew up my art.
Like an artist of <unk> <unk> walls, I <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the earth can do. If they let it be their canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool for transformation in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They were trying to see how it affects kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one time, who came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> on the night and they were in my garden, and they looked very <unk>
I, well, man, man, I felt bad that you were there, and I told you, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who were so close to me, and it just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people go to steal your <unk>
I mean, I say, "Oh no, I don't fear that you're going to be <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to get the <unk> but at his time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a refuge in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, that helped me download the truck.
It was great, they shared their stories about how this had affected and how they used to plant with her mom and his grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who are coming, work and <unk> all in a volunteer.
If kids grow up, they will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of these things are <unk> if you don't teach them how the food affects the mind and the body, they eat blind what they put in front of you.
I look at young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're zooming in, I look at color boys that are on this way that are on this path designed for them, that it doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these guys who are <unk> from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington George <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them in cafes healthy.
I didn't think about me.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
How about sustainability is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people to work on the street kids who know the joy, the pride and the honor of cultivating their own food, opening markets from farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
You get them to take your <unk>
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you're not called me if you want to sit in the comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk to you to do some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk>
It's made from <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water at the asphalt that you might expect.
And especially if you go into your bike and these cars go, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we would want a quiet <unk>
The solution to that is to make highways of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, has pores and water can go through it, so that all of the water water will flow down and will have a road where it's easy to drive, and you don't have any more.
Noise also disappear into these <unk>
Because it's very hot, all the noise on it, so it's a very quiet highway road.
It also has a <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is it <unk> You see that on this road the stones on the surface <unk>
First stone, then several more and more and more and more, and so on, you know, I won't do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also bring more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create holes with that.
<unk> It's ready.
And I mean, of course, that you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's an asphalt asphalt as I said, so only has a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of <unk> to light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if you were <unk> you will be <unk> and we split the <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you will pull the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about materials from <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool wool from that to clean <unk> and we can cut the <unk> of steel in very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is they heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones are attached back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> oven because I can't bring the big machine <unk> here onstage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the show that I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that it comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We test a lot of samples there, and then the government, they actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters of the highway <unk> where we had to do a lane of trial to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We made a lot of the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine and <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel fibers, bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the road, and they can even double the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they're curious about if this also worked.
We still have shown here. It's pretty hot.
In fact, you have to cool first first before you can show you how it hits you.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having aroused a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening on his little gray radio, gray radius.
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> she screamed for my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old, when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made them illegal that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be used outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we were going to take a different route so that nobody would suspect where it would be?
We had to hide the books in resource bag, so it looks like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us coated in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew we <unk> our <unk> the teacher, the students and our parents.
Instead, the school was suddenly close to a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew from us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you did it?
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters was <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in which his daughter, my mother to the school and therefore her father did it.
But my mother educated became mastery.
This is it.
It was left two years ago, just to turn our house home for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate your children.
During the years of <unk> I remember there were moments that I was very frustrated about our life and was always scared and not to see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter, mine, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. Can you be able to leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we need to sell our blood to pay for your education, we will do.
So you still want to be <unk>
I am 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the school, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself so proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate her daughters, it was one of the first in <unk>
He didn't just forget about my college degree, but I was also the first woman, and I'm the first woman who drove him through the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> ambassador, a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded <unk> the first one and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see the students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like mine, <unk> for them, despite the face of an opposition <unk> opposition.
As <unk> It's not the real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than one month ago, he and his daughter would go from <unk> to her village, and they literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice had broken her to his daughter to school, they would come back to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but I wouldn't harm the future of my daughter by your old and <unk> ideas."
What I've been aware of Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and that sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they're often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school come to school, remember, was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
I'm afraid that these changes would not last much, after the retirement troops in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, that the <unk> I see a future <unk> and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls of <unk> would give me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But never come back to a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the Tunisian revolution broke out, inspired by the <unk> <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution as the <unk>
A forces with a lot of other citizens built inside and out of the country to call one day of anger and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women and young men <unk> were at the edge, <unk> the fall of the regime, <unk> <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a courage to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, up to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of a brutal war and a few losses from about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing it.
However, <unk> left a heavy load of <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the culture of the liberal society of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have loved -- next to a lot of other women, rebuild civil society, <unk> a universal transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation, the national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national lonely.
It was established about 200 organizations in <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I came back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I began to organize workshops about developing capabilities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women, we started the <unk> of Women -- <unk> <unk> -- a movement of women, leaders, very <unk> to advocate for the autonomy of the woman and our right to participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> that was <unk> from the selfish policies of domination and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was approved, and our initiative was approved, and our initiative was approved, and our initiative was approved, and our initiative was approved, and our initiative was approved, and our initiative was approved, and our initiative was approved, and our initiative was approved, and our initiative was approved, and our initiative was approved, and our initiative was approved, and our initiative was approved, and our initiative was
The women won a U.S. Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of election and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
We woke up with the news of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Another day with the news murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of official officers from the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> human rights violations.
Our society, shaped by a <unk> mindset more, and it's removed from the ideals of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the icons of the revolution.
Now I'm not here today to be able to talk to our success success story and the election.
I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation we chose badly, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the choices didn't have peace, the stability and stability to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
So what happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by the selfish policies of domination and <unk> both by men as for women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than it needed the election that we just needed the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs <unk> representation of <unk> more than need to be <unk> and <unk> of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call it for days of anger.
We need to start acting as compassion agents and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, which not only <unk> but also put the mercy instead of <unk> <unk> collaboration rather than competition instead of being <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for war, needs to be able to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between female <unk> and the male <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to make that sort of existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions, has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which involves all of the humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the towns have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus covers completely the <unk> which grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion to bring all the existence.
This is what it tells us is saying, "My <unk> looks for all the things."
So it tells us, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
They are all aware of the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a funny question that has an equal answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the ones that all do a good thing. Why is it left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, and I'm not a social worker, no skilled in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that count.
I was 22 years old, I had just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York by my first work as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> green <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times the man, the man, that I believed my alma mater, I was attached to my head with a <unk> charged with bullets in <unk>
The man who loved anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap, for love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have a <unk> in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> among them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
About 20 years married my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, and all of the races, all the religions, all income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence is about women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> <unk> relationships or <unk> or said otherwise, in the families, the last place where we would want or we would expect to find <unk> for which, domestic abuse, is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who was sitting with a man who sticks, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, the women between 16 and 24 years of age have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their signals or patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, <unk> night of January.
I was sitting next to me in the subway in New York and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he was also <unk> from a college of <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me was that first I was ready and fun, and that it seemed like a <unk>
I had some big <unk> like apples and <unk> and wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of <unk>
He did it especially at the beginning of a <unk>
We started out and loved everything from me, which was so so that I had gone to Harvard, that I would put a passion to help girls teenagers, and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman had ever done it before.
And it was why the bachelor's in that <unk> school and the job on Wall Street and his bright future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was go from New York and leave the job of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your spouse, so I quit my job and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> and she was entering a physical <unk> financial trap, carefully <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it is.
And here is where those guns.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where it was supposed to be <unk> I had to feel so safe and bought three weapons.
One had in the car <unk>
Another kept underneath the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma for a small person.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never solved my hand, my life was seriously serious about each day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had <unk> I put my mother suit, and I married him.
Despite what had occurred, I was sure that we were living happily in forever, because I was loved and he also wanted to be a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just felt very <unk> by the wedding and by the fact that they form a family with me.
It was a isolated accident, and I never would make it hurt.
I spent twice more on our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so hard in the head that I had several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple days later, driving back from our moon of honey was <unk> by traffic and threw a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> were still going to run one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was excited when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One in three American women is the victim of domestic and bullying at some time in their life, and the Disease Control informs that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million children are <unk>
So I actually had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man who was the only person in the world who could help <unk> their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is: Why don't you get <unk>
Why don't I hate me at any time.
To me this is the saddest and painful question that people do because we do, because we victims, we know something that you are normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is kill it.
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence occur after the victim ever finally finally got to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions. They include permanent discussion, even after the <unk> has gone back to marriage, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family judicial system to bring to the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time in time not <unk> with the man who was <unk> to their mother.
And yet we keep asking why it's simply not going?
I was able to go, and I was able to go from a last <unk> beating my denial.
I realized that the man who loved that, he would have killed me if she would have allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the entire world: the police, to my neighbors and my friends and family, full unknown, and I'm here today because you all love me.
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims of the victims as headlines, and women are <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people is a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the victims of the victims are intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also learned that they learned a lesson of what happened to them and that they gave up their lives joyful life and happy lives like <unk> wives completely free violence, like mine.
Because it turns out I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence violence.
I got married with a cute little guy, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm going to do is not having more, ever, is a <unk> gun pointing at my head in the hands of someone who says that he wants to me.
At this moment, the same thing is thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> how dumb <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you, there are a few people who are listening to right now, who are being <unk> or that they were <unk> they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting his daughter, his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to put my crazy love to my crazy love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last petition to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> abuse just the silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
We victims victims around the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Take the abuse of the light talking about it with your children, your colleagues and family and family.
And they would look at their view of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the early signs of violence to be intervening consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims of a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis safe and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. My name is Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be accurate for 10 years now.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dress like this.  I'm lucky, I brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of luck in <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they were born, they don't have to take them now, but we would find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to go through this sweater through the head, because it's when you're going to laugh in me, so I don't do anything while I cover my head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed entirely what they thought of in six seconds.
And in this picture, I never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that I <unk> the back and the <unk> <unk>
Of course, except with surgery or an <unk> artificial <unk> like I did two days ago for work, there are very little that we could do to transform our looks, which, although although shallow and <unk> has a big impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave it means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
I always say, a <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made my model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a possibility, and maybe you're asking what is this inheritance.
Well, in the last centuries we haven't only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to <unk> we've also associated with a high and <unk> shape to the <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my cultural heritage, that I've known to harness to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> from the fashion that <unk> <unk> there are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing too much of models.
But sadly, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told every single one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- that's less than four percent, were not white people.
The next question that people always ask me is: Could it be model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't care about that.
But then, what I would really tell you to each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you were the first.
If after this list, I still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, so I tell you, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> executive <unk> or next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be a model to say that you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's outside of control, it's shocking, and it's not a work that you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model -- because, unlike <unk> surgery can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Sadly, once you finish up your studies, you have a copy and some jobs and work on your back, no matter what you're going to do, I mean, if you want to be president of the United States, but your urge <unk> from inner clothes for 10 years, people would look silly.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, it was pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I got in, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know that we're entering the personal field, but I was a little girl.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party, a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize I'm not in those pictures.
These are creations of a group of <unk> <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always going to ask me to do is make things for free?
I have too much heels.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red light in red and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege for me, not so I am. And there are people who are paying for a price for what they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the <unk> of the teenagers who stood up and 86 percent were black and Latino people, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of me.
It's about how many times I got <unk>
When I did research for this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure out to at 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a role model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you feel very happy and I am.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we got it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative and clever people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask them, with some thinner legs and the most bright hair will be more happy?
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the <unk> legs, the brighter and the laundry <unk> but probably the women physically <unk> on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of race and gender oppression when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that they retain from this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image of the image that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was most enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 photos more <unk> and I didn't go to the <unk>
There were no <unk> <unk> no chance to repeat the photos, not even a minimum amount in lighting.
In fact, most people pick up random tourists at random.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the <unk> corner of the 57 percent.
He just happened that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what's coming now.
When I approached the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you go to New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
This is when we started asking the tourists that were going to take us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has been denied and fortunately, no one has been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred to us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a five-year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than displays of a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time in October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, while we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how to perceive it and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
So recently, in one of travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden it was stopped in the dry and pointed out of a red <unk> of the dolls shop that <unk> in the previous hospital.
And I described to me that there was a sense of five years standing in that same place.
<unk> who remembered his heart <unk> <unk> to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look in in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that takes the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and I didn't get to walk down to somebody and asked, and it takes a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> group.
First, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughs as a silly <unk> characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep it clean the environment.  The <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two kinds of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mostly in the <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the World Bank, where we have 16 species species of extinction.
So why are those <unk> important, first of all, they provide alien organic services.
They're our <unk>
<unk> the cadavers into the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria to <unk> the anthrax that they wouldn't be for them would stretch and caused large losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historic importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of <unk> and maternity and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the age and lower Egypt.
In the <unk> Indian <unk> was the god <unk> and <unk> his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are getting very important <unk> to open sky in the places like the <unk> there is no place to bury the dead or the wood or <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical <unk> of extinction, -- which means that in less than 10 or 15 years, it's <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey on livestock of livestock that has been treated with a drug <unk> like the <unk>
This drug has been banned to <unk> in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge bomb bomb, you have a huge <unk> of time to <unk> the number of cases of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to the birds, they cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the market of <unk>
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're looking at <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so to focus on a sustainable problem that's not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking about them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? It can become assets, making noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you what we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you will tell you about <unk> but talk to your families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed because he saw it fly without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I'm not.   I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
I went to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
And instead of that, everything we would do is <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where I just decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So we got to the seeds of <unk> south of Zambia to this absolutely wonderful valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach the local and growing tomatoes <unk> and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they would tell them to come to work, and sometimes they weren't <unk>  We were amazed that the local ones in so <unk> they hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't hear anything, we simply said, "Thank God that we're here."  Let's take a time to save people from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk> <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato in Zambia.
And we can't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When the tomatoes were cute, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> came from the river and ate everything.  And we said, "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you <unk>
I thought that only of the Italians did mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, what they did, what they did and then see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> look at the <unk>  You know, look at the waste that they gave to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have delivered the African continent two billion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about damage that that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
It was part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the root <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if I was my kids, "I want a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of the different culture as if I was my <unk>
That's why white people are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face. Little <unk> <unk> written by <unk> who said about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman opened up this conference put a cane on the ground, and he said, we can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to be 27 years old, just answering people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you will never involve anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? It <unk>
It never comes to a community with an idea, and it feels with people from the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We meet in a coffee. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give him an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what do you do?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but the knowledge is available.
So years old and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting a community to tell people what to do, for one time, for once, I would give them up, but not in <unk> meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the <unk> meetings.
The entrepreneurs never come up with them, and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, which is a chance that have <unk>
So planning has this negative point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even have any, because they don't live in their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family of the business of the business, who will come up with you at your house, at the kitchen table in your kitchen table in your kitchen table and help him find the resources to transform his passion in a way to make a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia, city.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to get away from this junk garbage where we got to tell them what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects online, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
I was <unk>      So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor in philosophy before you get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
planning is the kiss of the death of the business spirit.
So now we have <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk to you.
You have to offer them for your privacy, it has to be fantastic to the help, and then you get older, they will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and <unk>
What is you going to do with you more this tomorrow?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So, what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution <unk> fossils -- not renewable energy, <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do that.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
Government <unk>
It'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a wonderful story that I read in a <unk> magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> came together this group of people, and they were trying to figure out what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is kept growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses.
They were already <unk> in <unk>  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that was <unk> in New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in 1900, in the United States <unk> <unk> manufacturers <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories in <unk> factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
But there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to give you <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk with you.
Then, you have to give you an absolute <unk> service.
And then then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The youngest company, the largest company has to be able to do three things -- the product you want to sell has to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell a fantastic marketing and you have to tell a great financial administration.
Guess what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that I can do, to sell and search for money.
It doesn't exist.
This was not born.
We've looked and looked at the 100 companies in the <unk> world, <unk> <unk> Ford, all the new, Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: No one was started by one person.
I never know the word about it, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he began.
Nobody begins one company by itself.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> in bars along with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what you did for you, what somebody did for this <unk> who will ask you, what needs you need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Well, you can see it -- you can look at the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." Let's look at <unk>
We activate the communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in a lot of ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't spend a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant tag that give you shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It's a <unk> of the music.  There is a <unk> in New York City, and the city has one of the most beautiful architectures of the world, but also one with the highest number of U.S. <unk>
I live near this house, and I thought how could it turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother to <unk>
His death was suddenly <unk>
And I thought a lot about death and I thought a lot.
And this was a deep gratitude for the living time.
It makes it clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But let me be able to keep this gaze in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to be able to be able to go through the day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this giant left house on a giant board and painted on her phrases for <unk> Before she died <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflecting on their lives and sharing personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die, I want to be <unk>  Before I die, I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before I die, I want to sing for millions of people who are <unk>
Before I die, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die, I want to give you once more."
Before I die, I want to go to the <unk>
Before I die, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes for people laugh at me laugh at me, and they gave me <unk> in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new and <unk> and it's about pushing the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is the most important thing to us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started receiving hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
That's why with my colleagues in the center, we did a kit and now have been done in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we show the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is very short and fragile.
<unk> is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death for death is one of those things that would make us more power.
If you think about death -- our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect the best thing that matters as individuals and as a community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, people around us can't only help improve places, it can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's very hot.
It's not speak, but transmits joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It's <unk> <unk> happen what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color color color.
You don't care religious differences and look at this: it's never <unk>
When he singing songs, of our childhood, trying to tell me the words that I can't even be <unk> it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year that he came out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, she had pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't look like <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds not fit into the <unk> concept of society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although they wouldn't consider it inside of it, that could only mean one thing -- which was <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, that <unk> is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that are increasing in the world, there's no cause to cure them.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self to be in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and actually didn't seem very interested in myself.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and he would find pleasure in the smallest things, like putting car cars around the room, just watch the washing machine, and eat anything that would be <unk>
As I was growing up, it became more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the hyperactivity <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature of a child that would see the world without boxes, a human being had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change normal.
<unk> passes the beauty that give us differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that you're wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could tell you one thing to <unk> and Sam and you know, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in your inner and, frankly, seeking normal, is the last sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been <unk> in the course of the <unk>
Penn State asked me, a teacher of communications, who would give a class of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> real <unk> of these students with their great minds, their great books and their great unknown words.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt like when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with my students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our larger challenges from energy to environment and health care, between others, and if we don't know and understand this, work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not to have these interactions.
But these great conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, please get <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us simply that they study the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing their science, careful with the <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as a stupid thing.
Rather, as Einstein said, it's all as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- and they're ways of connecting and <unk> with their content.
And when I present her work, forget about signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they call <unk>  What do they do the <unk> <unk> kill, and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this not only is boring, but it supports too much in the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> of example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the <unk> Tower <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then providing graphics that we bring to our other senses, and you create a deeper sense of understanding what they mean.
I think these are just some key to you that can help the rest of us open the door and look at the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all media --   Thank you.  Thank you.
One of my favorite words all over the Oxford English is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
While there was an editor of the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who looks for a public charge no matter -- which is a <unk> platform or the beginning, and that, when he won, it gets the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
So something about words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said on the camera <unk>
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the well-known name of <unk> <unk> who was faced with <unk>
He gave him in the <unk> Tower and <unk> but he had enough courage to face them, and in the end, he had such popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's literally.
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
Didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk> quality.
And not even that they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen King for a given term.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired of it, because this debate was going on for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want to be Washington <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call him the King if it would do it or his <unk> ideas.
And so they wanted to give him the most <unk> <unk> and more unfortunate title that they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invent the title. I had only meant before, but it was only meant by <unk> that we had a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was actually a insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would take it seriously.
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate is not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite, to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to follow there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> we may be waiting for <unk>
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is what I want to tell you about is that President of America doesn't sound so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads -- the largest economy in the world and a fleet of airline and airline vehicles and so on.
reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
<unk> his title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, and the appearance of it -- well, it was an uniqueness back then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the <unk> of 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that you're now President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to give you <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really really changes the words that what that could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet on a domestic mine in Ghana.
The air is continuous and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about but, above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones and <unk> with red tools.
Like others, I take a flashlight cheap light <unk> strapped to the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that drops a hundred feet on the ground.
I was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met a <unk> that I met in a days before, who lost control and 2,000 feet on that well.
As I talk to you today, these guys are in the deep way of that hole to risk their lives without paying no payoff and often dying.
So I went home and I went home, but they may never will, because they're prey from slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> in the G8 Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO which is about to eradicate modern slavery.
So we started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew there was in the world, but not in the grade.
When we ended up talking to me that I was really <unk> I honestly was to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me just like the stomach and a few weeks later, I flew in L.A. to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, it had been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered them my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty dirty ones.
A conservative calculation says that currently there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the amount of Africans displaced all the time of slave slave themselves.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary for a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of a few thousand dollars today.
However, we can be enslaving entire families for generations by debts by 18.
<unk> slavery generates more than <unk> million dollars a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with false health promises and better work to find that they are forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but the ones that produce are disposable them.
slavery exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, children -- in fact, <unk> families in a heavy meter of <unk> stack of mechanically <unk> <unk> bricks in their heads, until 18 at the time, and take them from the <unk> furnaces to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
They slept on the <unk> and tiredness works in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no breaks to eat, or to drink, and the severe <unk> would make it even quite <unk>
As <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I think, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly that to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't give you any direct help.
I couldn't give you any money, nothing.
I wasn't in the country.
I could put them into an worse situation that they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system by his liberation and he trusted you to do it.
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children lugging stones for miles through <unk> <unk> to trucks waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who charge and kids are <unk> them on their heads with straps and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all their life.
Do you have nothing with it?
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> <unk> rich homes.
When you hear the word <unk> we often think about sexual trafficking, and because of this world awareness, they told me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
I took me through a little bit of stairs which led me to this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as it is known as the craft, are local for prostitution force.
They have small, private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of the only seven years -- are forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every post it's dark and <unk> identified by a number of painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
<unk> often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
On the <unk> I remember making sense of a acute acute fear and, in that minute, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that hell.
I just had one <unk> the stairs where it was going.
There was no <unk>
There were no windows of big enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual traffic is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sexual <unk>
It is everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that we often associate with the labor labor.
I visited Indian villages where there were entire families in the age of silk <unk>
This is a family friend.
The white hands of black is the father, the blue and blue <unk> of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, could be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where you really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I was going to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a <unk> family on a boat, two older brothers, some more young children -- some more young kids have a sense, right?
<unk> They were all the slaves.
Kids are separated from their <unk> families who are forced to work <unk> on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came over there was <unk> and it was meant that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling water.
The branches of the trees <unk> in Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, and with fear, they get to water to unlock the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
By fear of his self is not going to run out, and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it deals with the youngest slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were born, the last networks, but they had been working from the one of the <unk>
<unk> and <unk>
And you can point that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes what possible.
Who will come to be thank you that somebody decided to make the difference in your life?
They went through a road in Ghana with partners of <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their realities, <unk> and <unk> our car and played the window.
They asked us to put it on a way of land to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we would get rid of the car, and asked the driver to come out very quickly.
Then he pointed out this path barely visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started to <unk> we took the <unk> that would look at the path and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> for the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of my head as I put in these waters up to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up <unk> in a bit and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football, and all of them were full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had tied kids bound to their backs and, as they were looking for gold, <unk> in the waters <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a pump in another part of Ghana.
When they came out the pump were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember he looked at his favorite eyes, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells are up to 90 meters and these people carry heavy bags of rock that then will be <unk> to another area where they would get the stone to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look more closely, the margin is going to work at least the least fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> is going to end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> to mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> When he died her father she took him to work with him in mines.
When they die his uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt of what force is going to be slave in mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the mines 14 and the leg injury that you see here is a crash accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said that it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
And yet, he said, to be liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this is this kind of determination, in the face of the remote possibility that inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will <unk> witness to them and we'll do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult for atrocities like slavery.
These images are not out of magazines. It's about people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I don't think about these so many beautiful people that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images take a force in those people you see, in people like you, and I hope that that force will turn a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do applied math -- and there is a particular problem for whom <unk> we are kind of a management writer.
No one knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try to tell you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities.
We are <unk> from the <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll see more ahead.
But the cousin demand a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably a certain initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Sadly, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's <unk> destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a virtuous dancer dancing.
Over the last few years has been made a lot in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a weakness <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we're going to know whether there is really a cure to be when we have an objective metric and objective <unk>
But it's frustrating for the Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers that are not <unk> and the best we have is a neurological exam for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of the clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test they <unk>
It doesn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to do is that I want to go to you as a way that is not conventional for a try, you see, in some sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vowels.
It shows someone healthy as it gives you sound when you talk about it as a dancers of a false dancer because we have to coordinate all of those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes that are needed by the <unk> for example.
And as the smile. It requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time that leads to a child learning to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as <unk> and as Parkinson's disease affects the <unk> also affecting the vowels.
You can see the bottom down you can see a <unk> example of the vowels.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with clinical trials -- well, they're both <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole bunch of hospitals to do it.
They're both <unk> OK, but also the <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as much as a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens.
When something takes such a <unk> cost. It shows up <unk>
These are some incredible goals to help address.
We can reduce the patient <unk>
I would not do need to go to the clinic for pregnancy <unk>
Ultimately, we could often get advanced data.
We could make mass <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at the general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when I give you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these targets.
We have local lines accessible for about 750 million people in the world.
You can call it with Parkinson's disease, it can call under price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let me take all of these samples of, say 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who isn't it?
What will you get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yes. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease.
<unk> You see, some people can not afford it, you may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the factors of confusion for the real markers of disease.
TR: You have a <unk> of accuracy at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job and now it has now shown that it works on the mobile cell network as well, what we do is we have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were stuck in the dark, in rooms with no windows and usually we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models, the perfect skin -- the perfect skin is still more perfect -- we do the impossible and we get into the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste for the images and the photograph.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that happened in Japan.
And so long later, an organization where I was <unk> there was <unk> -- it was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a small <unk> village in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The water level recorded over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers land inside.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
We take rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools.
We took tons and tons of dead fish, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We love and loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> photos and cameras and <unk>
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places from people around the villages around them.
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a center of <unk> of the people.
It helped clean the toilets, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the <unk> center took the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor that that day was <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I'd heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went beyond my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some that had over a hundred years were still in the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I got on Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started putting the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too much <unk> but where the water had aroused the face of the girl had to get rid of a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise, that little girl wouldn't have the aspect of her itself, and that would be so tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time, they got sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of <unk> and they needed more <unk> so this is that I went back to Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a people in Northern <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the libraries of the temporal libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time I <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could be an hour. I could get a couple of weeks.
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand using the areas whose color and detail -- the water was not destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these photographs in salt water covered with bacteria, with algae, and even with oil, all of it with the passage of time continue <unk> -- that's why <unk> was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean up, dry and <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a guide to a <unk>
It's very easy to harm even the photos already <unk>
As a <unk> once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman that brought us these pictures was lucky in the photos.
I had begun to <unk> herself but stopped by realizing that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and their own face would not have been able to <unk> the images in a single photo and get the full picture.
When I collected their pictures shared some of his history with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble so far away from where he used to be his home, but his colleagues <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
His small children, not so small now, but their two children were at school, in a different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took a week to find his entire family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her pictures his youngest child at the age of 14.
To her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could do -- something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember about the past day that would not have been marked around that day from March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there -- hundreds of them helped us clean up to <unk> more than <unk> photographs -- the great <unk> -- the great majority became their hands of their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring to 90 families hundreds of full photos and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than <unk> in teams and materials, most of them on ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, somebody wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take for us, but the first thing they would try to look for.
This is the project of restore small pieces of humanity, to bring it back to someone their connection with the past.
When a picture of it gets back to someone, it is a huge difference in the life of the person that is coming in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger, to bring something larger, using their talent to something that are not very thin skin.
I would like to finish this email -- I sent him Cindy the day I went back from Japan after six months.
As <unk> I couldn't avoid thinking about people and the stories in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, gathering about a baby, because a picture of my family -- my grandmother, my mother, I and my <unk> daughter was hanging from our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in one exhibition of just a billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not to a million or a billion, but a trillion <unk> per second.
So I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique so fast that can create video of the light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and really challenging <unk>
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it on and <unk> in a second <unk> and it is, in a number of <unk> to create a pack of photons just one millimeter in between.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel to the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet <unk>
If we take that bullet and this pack of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how are those photons into this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   remember, all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel to the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not going to take this research.  Let's think about a lot of stuff in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
So the pulse, our <unk> enters the bottle with a pack of photons that starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts <unk>
Part of the light <unk> goes down to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and they explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble. You can see, inside.
At that time, the waves travel down the table, and because of the insights from the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a common and common bullet and we make it <unk> the same distance and we see it on slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually, every year.
It would be a very boring movie  of a slow bullet to motion.
And what about <unk> <unk>
And you can see the waves that were spreading from the table, and the tomato wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at it once more of this tomato <unk> you'll realize that, as the light <unk> <unk> it is still bright.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces off inside and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify whether the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So why did we create this camera at <unk>
As photographers, you know, if you take a photo down exposure, it gets very little light in.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition, so you can just get into some light.
So we sent that <unk> that <unk> that <unk> billion times, and we recorded again and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> of data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data on crude and <unk> in a interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible heroes.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to see after <unk>
The idea is that we could throw a little bit of light on the door. You get into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from the way to the camera, from there.
And where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We've built it.
On the left, is our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different moments of times.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capabilities there.
It has very good time resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also even the hidden objects, but we don't know what point it would be <unk>
So at projecting a laser can you record a picture in <unk> that, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, tens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we be able to see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could make cars that are <unk> collisions with what's around the curve, around the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected in the open windows.
Or we could be able to build <unk> capable of seeing the inside of the body <unk> <unk> and the same thing for the <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood is quite difficult, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new model of visualizing the problems to solve the problems of the next generation.
So as a <unk> <unk> he turned science science an art of <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collected is not just for scientific visualizations but we can see that we can see it.
And to create a new form of computer photography, with slow motion and colored code.
And let's look at those waves, remember, the time between each of those waves is just about a second.
But this is also a lot of fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these will go from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have very strange effects. And Einstein would have loved this image.
The order of the events happen in the world sometimes comes in front of the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's already time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change life, and gives you individual freedom to give you.
With a cell phone <unk> a crime against the humanity in Syria.
You can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
And with a mobile phone can you record a song, and you can see <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment with this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people have been looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they were looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who from them have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your cell phones, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a <unk> wow!
It's a lot. Almost everyone today has a cell phone.
But today I'll talk about my mobile, and how I changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
disorders.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This board says that every single company, but every monopoly of all of Europe, has to store a broad range of information from the users.
Who calls Who who sends an email to whom.
Who sends some text.
And if we use your mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in your telephone company, or your Internet <unk>
And all of Europe stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone <unk> and the Internet <unk> all this information about us.
There were lawyers, <unk> everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who went out to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police in Eastern East <unk>
And I also asked me if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> who was then the largest telephone company in Germany, which please give me all the information you had on me.
I asked them once, and I got them back to them, and I didn't get a particular answer, and it was all blah, <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to make a judicial lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we don't give you this information.
At the end, he agreed.
They took the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing about brown with a CD inside.
And the CD was this.
Thirty and five thousand dollars of information.
At first I saw them, and I said, well, it's a huge file. OK.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> What should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I am, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and pull out, go back and go forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I go from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call it the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little bit of fear.
But it's not just me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talk a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call each other, and the other one another, and we ended up with this big network of communication.
You can see how people communicate each other to what time they call each other, what hour to sleep.
You can see all this stuff.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control its society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks with "Who who sends an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all of these people on the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I participated in this protest, and if <unk> had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might never have happened.
And as a result, not the fall of <unk> <unk>
Because today, city agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible in and out of the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to be <unk>
But the <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go back home, tell your friends that privacy is a 21st century value and it's not <unk>
When you go home, tell your representative that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remind you that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, that's why you spend all the time.
Have a look.
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. <unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, brothers, even though they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that I came up with at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any one of us to do.
It feels bad for me, because at some point of life, you have to be disabled to me.
Let's go for a ride.
Christmas Christmas -- they're in the shopping center, drive in circles and <unk> and what do you see?
16 empty places to disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
Also, I tell you, I have a 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I had a gold medal.
I'm <unk> Muslim <unk> and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I am in Kenya, <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood, my disease had the same beginning.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I do it.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in your se <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk>
If my three big sisters I <unk>
If my three big sisters went to public school, my parents would go to the school system, and they were <unk> that I was out there, and if we didn't take all the ultimate note all of my mother.
My father taught me about walking at the age of five to my feet on his feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me so that I would take it out.
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong.
Yeah. The first day in kindergarten walked as a <unk> <unk> who has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and they were all of the family.
Now there's 20 Arabic, and they're still all of the family --  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as <unk>
The people I grew up with no problem with my faith.
But yet, it seemed like a lot of people from hunger during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating three and no eating -- so <unk> at dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> me as well.
And when my friends were going to go on summer on the coast of college, I was not going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get into <unk>
On my summer vacation often my father tried to <unk> so I would drink milk from <unk> to put me up with warm cups on the back, put me on the Beaufort Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the Buddhist cure was the yoga.
I should say it's very boring, but before I do yoga it was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on the head.
My parents were making this idea that I could do anything that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant for the University of Arizona, because I went in all the <unk>
It was like the mascot of the theater.
All of me <unk>
I did all the tasks at least smart, I took the fastest note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I made a scene from the crystal zoo my <unk> teachers.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in <unk>
It's a work of a girl with cerebral palsy, <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral palsy,
So I started screaming at four <unk> when I finally got a <unk>
I have paralysis, <unk>
At the end of the end of the end of the end, it <unk>
Thank God <unk> I was finally <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater department crying and crying as if someone had killed my cat, ask him why and she said to me because they thought it couldn't do the risk stunts
And I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the risk stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a role for that that literally had been born and gave it to an actor without <unk>
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability with disabled papers.
By <unk> I went back home, and my first tour, <unk> was like extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> <unk> friend in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that professional directors are not going to be able to, not white, with disability.
Just give perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common:
So I made myself <unk>
On my first tour, he took me famous watches of New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that I took when he fell at the account.
I worked in <unk> in the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, not <unk> and <unk>
Some people say that I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like reclaim the first place, but I know you have never heard that little magic rumor that says that women are not fun and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Film Festival in New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in media <unk> and I will remind you to <unk> <unk> and Arabs are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier than fighting the challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited as invited to the news program. It has come back with Keith <unk>
I went back as if I went to a graduation dance, I was watching a study and sat down in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, "Excuse me, I can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I held myself at the head of the speaker so they couldn't go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't come to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but she was just like <unk> and pasted my chair.
It's a lot of fun that I learned right with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
The kids are <unk> but they never get away from me or a girl nor a little bit of a girl.
All of a sudden, my Internet disability became an object of <unk>
<unk> video clips like, "Why do you <unk>
"Is it <unk>
And my favorite favorite -- the terrorist <unk>
What disease does it?
We really should be praying for her."
A piece of <unk> suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
disability is as visual as the race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then you can't make someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said they don't understand, but I'm here in front of you.
If you have grown up with media media, I don't think it <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that <unk> less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we need the entire society to teach well our children.
My journey has led me to a very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world -- Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in New Jersey state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The children of <unk> a charity to give kids to Palestinian refugee children, a tiniest tiny part of what my parents got to me.
It was the only time my father saw me live live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small village.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town in the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives a small village to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without nothing for him there, it's going to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, there's no job, no <unk>
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk>
One day you give him a guy who offers it to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
He knows a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
They show a young boy.
They finally got home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a car bomb.
That kid in that little village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist -- and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a drug terrorist organization with Al Qaeda.
So how did the story of a child a small village trying to fulfill his dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for it.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing to come.
This was the first thing that pulled him from what we call "the <unk> period.
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> urban young urban young people who <unk> <unk> riots in the <unk> <unk> in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for jobs, for well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door to terrorism, to violence, to <unk> will be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not go to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit Hospital Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in the hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had seen myself forced to be in that same <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support some young leaders at a business peak.
Tell about 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the great challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunities.
I remember when he said to me, that because I was a graduate graduate university college, it was the perfect white <unk> for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point B is the street.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the road system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a company of <unk>
He started <unk> motorcycles to the local residents who were normally unable to <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and their dream is at some point expand to hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do you do?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's <unk> spirit and I believe that business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
They give young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so many.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business making, and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from the <unk>
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is, <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
He created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for abuse, creating gardens in the houses, and the business companies and now is working in the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not <unk> pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the department of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for a NGOs working for the government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
Los encouraged to believe that could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
We have business solutions for local problems.
So, inspiring young people and create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and guidance to guide them in the development and set up their business.
They give young people with the resources that they need to do is the support that they need to move from understanding to creation, and will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, entrepreneurship is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed isn't simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Peace Park is how it calls it when it's created, to transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the <unk> for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to make the young people in the entrepreneurs, and they were <unk> and <unk> their <unk> innovation and will have more stories about flowers and <unk> from the Peace <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> area in the state of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest.
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not going to be the way that we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that ground.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful Lake Lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed was a <unk> of about four feet with apple hearts with apple <unk> <unk> and old <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought he was going to clean their <unk>
That question followed with me, and it was just a little bit.
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter how <unk> or where <unk> <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the clean Department of <unk> our garbage, for 11 thousand tons of waste and 2,000 tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to know that as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
And I traveled on the trucks and walked through his trajectories and I interviewed people in office and facilities all over the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get a lot more.
So I started working as <unk>
Now I can't just walk in the trucks. I am <unk>
And operated the mechanical and bar and bar the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
You all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe -- and in the days that it's very strong you can get very quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of taking over their body out of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> water collection is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and getting into traffic all the day and go off around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And the crap itself is full of dangers that often fall from the truck and cause terrible harm.
I also learned about the garbage <unk>
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the crap is like a force of nature itself.
Never stop coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It always needs to be moving.
And also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that the <unk> of waste are the most important workforce in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first protective of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the waste of efficient and effective every day, this starts to move away from their containers and their dangers inherent to us in real ways.
We mean that we had been controlled for decades and centuries come back and start <unk>
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we don't have space for what the motors of the economy are starting to fail when it's at risk action.
I'm not advocating that capitalism, I just throw up his relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed need.
I mean simply at the speed of the time that we used to move in the little <unk>
We don't usually give us <unk> or <unk> or we carry with us our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know there is a job of work on the other side that we take for it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about water collection that maybe help to reduce the stigma and focus on that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every single day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when you go.
And their work allows us to do our own.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us in except for ourselves, of our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow will always have to stay in one form or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection of waste in the street, grabbed my child down and went down the stairs and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his paper <unk> like I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank him for doing his work that particular day, but I started to cry.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that, I started researching the collecting of waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we worked together a lot of times and made us good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have in account all the costs, even the very real human cost.
municipal waste is what we think when we talk about junk -- represent three percent of the amount of waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next few people who see someone whose job is to clean the junk of you, you will take a moment to get it to you.
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our communal life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
So today I brought two projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial <unk> center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa <unk>
This is the kind of construction that we showed up like my team and me about what we needed to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to leave <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects of the city.
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because of the crystals with crystals generating heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, what does it have nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a place as rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit Ethiopia, in our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really fluent with the old market that is this structure in the air that is the open air structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every single day.
That's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a building, building, several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the <unk> the site that is located in a much growth zone in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, not there.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs from the building.
And it spreads out with a rotten atrium, which creates a space in the open air in the building that <unk> its own shape and rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the space of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that would go to the local weather conditions.
And I started thinking of a tissue similar to a <unk> concrete <unk> to allow the air to the air, and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> which are the windows that are going to get the air and light in a controlled way inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little color crystals that use light from the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it didn't be easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it wasn't what they <unk>
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was a lot more profitable than the commercial center, because in the end of it there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary for air <unk>
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy energy for building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this oasis of urban <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which is set up collected water for inner spaces.
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the biggest that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also to its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a dozen <unk> Internet doors connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was broaden the streets that are existing by creating 12 very similar building blocks and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some dots in relation to the idea of interconnected doors with straight lines, and this change the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell cell project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So I put up a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections for the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local rules that set a higher density at higher levels and lower density in the ground plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as giving the community to the space occupied space.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and get it up and do activities such as a race of two kilometers in the morning, or to jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes to the local communities and local economies at the same rate as buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had a very bright <unk> and a little <unk> of <unk> <unk> It was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year, and I was full of <unk> until I was going to <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I was left at a time after the way out of school, I was a little bit late and she was <unk> in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was finished, I went into the classroom, I took off the table of my master's teacher.
And then, I did.
<unk> the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a little bit.
All the Like --  And I got to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> we have the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put together all rows of <unk> and myself a row of it, just to be there, because I had to be there.
I'm still amazed by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It was all obvious <unk>
I would never be surprised.
But most of all, I was telling me the reason why I was bothered by the reason that this was so small, it was so good for <unk>
I transferred to jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the excess of the birds are very <unk>
We know that the <unk> are the number one cause by spouses in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because the novels are like the lab where they study the <unk> in all of their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There was no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
It wouldn't have Shakespeare.
<unk> the reading lists of high school lists because we'd be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> there is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as soon as they have all of them.
This year you get to a hundred years of his masterpiece, "In search of the <unk> time -- the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> mine, and everything we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details of it, right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forget about how <unk> it is.
I mean, it's books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as a cat <unk>
I don't know how the cat <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious like the <unk> that are cut to the person to desire, to their desire, they are a good narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we felt jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being the time storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details of <unk> to <unk> the knife -- right?
<unk> make us all novelists and that's something that I was going to understand.
All that she does to give me pleasure out of the other thing that she could give to the other time right now."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every single charm charm that <unk> senses in his lover adds to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break off with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's a <unk> emotion.
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> get rid of the information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the big <unk> and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> would get rid of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links well the language <unk> with the jealousy.
When I <unk> it is in his <unk> agony of soon listening behind the gates and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- so they are defending these behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with true <unk> value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us look like <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for real search of truth, a truth, that's true, in fact, what to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth.
<unk> <unk> <unk> These were the pathways toward <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need -- that makes us suffer, it causes us to make a lot more profound and more vital feelings than a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to go search for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> will reveal us ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
There is some other emotion to us, our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at <unk> intensity as well.
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young man who was being used with the idea that his wife did it.
And Freud said that there was something strange in that man, who didn't fit in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife did, without realizing it.
<unk> <unk> or accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious, of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
The novels describe very well how <unk> are doing <unk> but accurately.
In fact, the more <unk> we are, the more we make us into the fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to do violent or illegal.
<unk> are moving us to behave in completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me for the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard about the news.
One woman from Michigan, age of age was captured by having created a false piece of Facebook from which he would send <unk> messages to itself, for a year.
For one year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of her former boyfriend. I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with awe.
Because, let's be realistic.
How big -- although we bring creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange character in the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to do the <unk> <unk> and once we're in the sphere, in the realm of the <unk> the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> is going to be <unk> or want what you have to take your self and get rid of what you ever <unk> and it's under the floor. <unk> to your name, takes your rings, <unk> your <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route for Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> around the world, both as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we are good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I have always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the chief face of <unk> rat <unk> which needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
You need to need their help, but you get it, and you get it into <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> -- once you come up with you, you come up with your solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to leave your hand.
It's one of the times that we see relocated from the story. It seems to me this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It looks like treating them as a problem of geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they are at the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are actually a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So while we hope that that happens, we remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Only fiction is jealousy.
The fiction used to invite them to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> the scary <unk> Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21st of July 21, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the Apollo module.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence on the gray surface is the culmination of a collective <unk> process.
The Apollo program was the greatest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave work to about 400,000 people and asked collaboration with 20,000 companies, and universities and government agencies.
They died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, of which he picked up after Armstrong died, last year, is the most <unk>
So why do you work?"
They didn't brought a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The <unk> answer is that President Kennedy was because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation was better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in <unk> they give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why do you <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why do the mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why would you fly on the <unk>
Why do he play Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> The <unk> wasn't just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
In the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> before the powers of the technology.
It was because it was really great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we could not go faster than a horse, or a boat with candle <unk> but in 1969, the Apollo crew crew flew 40,000 miles old hour.
Since 1970s, no human being went back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of the Apollo 10, and the happy optimism of the power of technology has evaporated to see that the problems that we imagine that technology would solve like going to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the global population seem to be <unk>
I remember the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that they didn't go to the <unk> tube <unk>
I knew most of this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was totally sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that's what it came to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have distracted us with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've <unk> our lives.
But they don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, which is <unk> that have created less ambitious companies that are <unk> from the years that we have <unk> <unk> Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are <unk> specifically, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused by creating ideas of <unk> ideas, or even the false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It's mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred tiny investment investments that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing with benefit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is long-term term, not in the development of technologies that are intended to solve big problems because they don't have an immediate <unk>
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated, deep and profound.
Sometimes, we chose to not solve big problems.
We could go to Mars if we were <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision to be popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are things more important than doing on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from sources of renewables as solar -- wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason it's completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete on price don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties -- the development of an active energy -- <unk> a significant increase in research and development, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we'll see an energy policy from America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that appear technological, it is not to be.
We know for long time that famines are result of failure at the way for food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis affecting the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and food making, but there will be famines while there was bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President <unk> declared the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many different types of cancer, some highly resistant to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and need to, but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population should want to want to want to address the problem, the institutions need to support the <unk> must actually be a <unk> problem, and we have to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it holds up with those <unk>
But it's a model model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there is no popular <unk> of science fiction as we can explore the solar system.
Usually going to the moon turned out to be straightforward.
I was only three days.
And really, it wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We are alone in our present, and the solutions of the future are going to be more difficult to get.
God knows not the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start to give you the ideas of thinking about confidence.
They're so common that they've become <unk> in our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a large decline of trust, is a very widespread belief, of trust, is a very widespread belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should regain trust.
I think that <unk> the goal and the task has been wrong with it.
What I'm going to try to talk about today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, that I think gives you a more clear idea about it.
First, why do people think that trust has been <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I dare to think that it may have gone down in some activity or institutions and institutions that might have risen on others.
I don't have sure.
But I can turn to opinion surveys and opinion surveys are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion surveys over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are reported about 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, they continue to define the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still pretty much <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen citizen is almost exactly halfway off.
But is this evidence enough?
What traditional opinion surveys are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you're looking at is criminal attitudes that people are doing when they do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody else will tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
They would go into the <unk>
<unk> on the <unk> teachers.
You probably ask for asking, "What do you do?
And that would be a very fair response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other not."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit confidence <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust we're going to feel for a certain type of official official or a person, it's going to be a uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, to say that I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to give the reading, but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my <unk> friend to keep a conversation, but not, perhaps, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way trust is <unk> why we stop all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think these surveys are really bad tools to measure the real confidence in real trust, because they try to deal with the good serious judgment in fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal I <unk>
I would encourage you to have more confidence in which it's trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> not to trust what is not reliable.
And I think those people who were going to raise their savings with the very German named Mr. Madoff, who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say, you know, he says, yeah, OK, that means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is to make a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think in order to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that a person is competent in <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of confidence.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest -- but they didn't get in order to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends that are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that they would be <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If so, I haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do with you to pick up before we trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be?
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we have tried to build systems from accountability for all kinds of institutions, professional officials and others, that make us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see, the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I do."
And we found the same problem in our public life, and we found that the system of accountability which is meant to ensure the <unk> and testing tests actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that we would call the <unk> as we say.
All of you know similar examples.
They put all of that, by the goal.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if they were going to be worthy of trust and <unk> the people that we are trusted and if you try to determine whether other people or politicians are worthy of confidence.
It's not easy. It is the trial, simple <unk> <unk> which is not <unk>
Third, the task.
It makes the task reconstruct the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve confidence.
But trust, ultimately is defining because we give the dirty other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the basics so that they can trust you.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> by all people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to bring some evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That gets every day, everywhere, makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple example.
The store where I buy my socks on it -- says I can get them over without a explanations.
I take them and get me the money, or they change it by the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they have become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're pointing at is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of the computers have come to us, to reduce the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly becoming more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if I hadn't <unk>
I started imagining what it would be.
I first created this tool that gets deeper into digital space, so that when the strong <unk> of the screen transfers its physical body to <unk>
Designers can make their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs below the screen.
So with this tool the booms.
But the two hands are still out of the screen.
How do we get inside and interact with digital information using the whole skill <unk>
In the <unk> Sciences of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital digital area of work.
It was <unk> a transparent <unk> bombsight to detect the fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, reach inside of 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and try to highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is down on the floating screen.
<unk> can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
So in these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
We have a lot of us have bought a lot of us bought and turned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make that physical be physicists so that we can be <unk> and <unk>
How would you be a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this single physical pixel together.
This magnet, <unk> behaves like a pixel in 3D space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this small three-dimensional space.
So what we did is we <unk> the gravity and controlling the movement through a combination of levitation and magnet and <unk> and <unk>
And when you use the object, we released it out of the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach yourself physically and distance and the famous <unk> by Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality, the times we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the planets of planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors textbooks, or textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what is more fascinating than changing the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not only going to show you something but that begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without that we have to have that <unk> from our world.
So we started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was excited to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to take a school to athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they create firmly that there was just a <unk> path toward the <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter whether I work or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer to be an opera <unk>
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult would tell you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
I would argue that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was all about what we could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I solved looking for another <unk>
No one all around me wanted to <unk> Okay.
They went back to books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> I got to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> deals with Chinese life.
And it's not <unk> convenience.
The Bible is interesting, but they say.
That's a theme for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told me, "It's so different, and so much better than it <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> guilt.
The meeting with a new culture also gave place to my reading <unk>
It was a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map I thought was out of place because this is what students in China learn it.
I had never occurred, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are up to research fields like comparative <unk> and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers to academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why do you not do it in life <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk>
For <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
To Buddha, they are all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> path <unk> <unk> <unk> Instead of getting lost in the translation, he found that you can make a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know it will not be used or powerless before.
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many other people have ever met.
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place of the dreams, where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Until a stick dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books are always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology, at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex entered the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw on the couch in my office and he took off the shoes and said he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> <unk>
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought together the sessions, it became easy for me to just move the head while we get the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he was saying Alex, and what I looked like, she was right.
You start working on, you start working afterwards, you have kids later, even the death happens later.
For <unk> like Alex and I had time to <unk>
But little later, my <unk> pushed me to press Alex that I would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yeah, he's coming out of the guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like I was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No no, but maybe it <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in Alex is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they did, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a break.
This made the <unk> of Alex being the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of recklessness <unk> was a real problem, and I had real consequences, not just for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they think no one goes to adulthood without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, Yes! They're incredible.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take away the dream of a <unk> I want to see. It's okay. <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen at the age of 35 years.
This means that eight of 10 decisions and experiences and moments -- that they shape your life will have happened to when you have 30 and <unk>
I don't get to panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we get.
We know more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and final stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during its <unk> than at any other time in life and we know that the female fertility comes to her top six to the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to protect them about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday and common life has an impact on the person who are <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in developing development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
The researchers call the <unk> a extended adolescence.
The journalists gave them <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and you say, you get another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and their ambition and absolutely nothing happens there.
And then all the days -- smart, smart, interesting stuff, like you or your kids and kids come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship will not be killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before 30, everything will be okay."
But then it starts going to sound like this: "My <unk> <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show.
I had better copy the day I graduated from college.
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then somewhere around the 30, the music turned the music and everyone began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who was standing, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit end, but it doesn't make the risks very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there is a huge amount of pressure to the 30 and so many of them starting a career, choosing a city, choosing a couple, you have two or three kids in a much more short time period.
So many of these things are not <unk> and there's some research that starts to show -- which is much more difficult and stressful <unk> to do everything in the <unk>
The middle of middle-aged age is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
<unk> you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about his <unk> "What was you doing? What was you doing?
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having a identity crisis, having a crisis of identity.
He said that he would like to work in art or the entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so what happened the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, which was more <unk> than ambition.
And despite the fact that they were going to live very difficult, his earlier life had been even more difficult.
And they were often often in our sessions, but then she would wake up to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma, came his head on his legs and cried for nearly the hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning with his whole <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words of emergency words, please call <unk>
It was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be if I have an accident.
Who is going to take care of if I gave you <unk>
At that time, I took a lot of work to resist and don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit as the decade of Emma was going on.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> or woman deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma who <unk> of that identity and identity capital of identity.
For identity, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what you want to be after.
I didn't know the future of the race of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I do know this: capital capital generates identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try to try it.
I'm not <unk> the <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that should not count, which, by the way, is not exploration, right?
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who <unk> jobs and make it count.
Second, I told Emma the urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with the similar minds are limited when they know what you know, how they think about, how talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out of almost always comes from the nearest circle.
The new things come from what they're called links <unk> friends of friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half not, and the weak bonds are the form of <unk> to this group.
The middle of the jobs that we created is never <unk> then to know the head of your neighbor is the way we get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
<unk> but not least, Emma believed you don't choose to your family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as I was growing up, Emma soon <unk> his family when she has a couple, and it exists his own family.
I told Emma the time to choose her family had come.
Maybe you think that the 30 is better to sit in your head than the 20 or even the 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person that you live now or you're going to give you now when everyone on Facebook starts to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before we get it, and that involves being so intentional in love as you're in work.
<unk> your family must be an conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or kill time with whoever you get to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the fellow <unk> of a cousin who worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That business supply gave a reason to leave the boyfriend that I lived in.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
He's married with a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, loves her new family, and I sent me a letter that he said, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like planes coming out of the Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight fit in your trajectory makes the difference between landing or <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21, the 25 and even <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years, or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> like every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get your identity, and use your weak links pick up your family.
Don't let me define what they didn't know or what they didn't.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in <unk> <unk> for a work that was even more <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to seventh grade in the public public schools.
And as any teacher, I took test tests and tests.
I gave them tasks.
When I work back, it was <unk> grades.
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had better performance didn't have <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in terms of mathematics in seventh grade, safe, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every single one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better ways.
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a quick way, and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National National <unk> and we tried to predict what kids were going to do as far as possible in the competition.
We studied professors and working in neighborhoods, really difficult -- what teachers are going to be teaching for the end of the school year and of <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the learning results of their <unk>
We teamed up with private, asking people, what about these vendors are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, emerged a feature as an important success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health, and it wasn't I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and resilience to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is having a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to his future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not speed.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students that did my questionnaires of determination and then waited for about a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater likely to <unk> even when we put them in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the evidence -- even though they were in school.
So it's not just in West Point or in the National <unk> National <unk> where the <unk> matters -- it's also in school, especially for kids at risk.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little it knows about the science of development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we develop the determination in children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid job ethic.
How are you going to keep them motivated by the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the commonly determination of course, is not related to it or it's even related to <unk>
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing determination in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they die, because they don't think that that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start everything again with the <unk> lessons.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as a daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was inspired by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems like <unk> like the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been asking me if I can break down this <unk> so that anyone who might want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new and quick method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every single character of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we just have five minutes, better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20 thousand characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy to you.
The first 200 people will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read <unk> menus of <unk> to understand the basic idea of the pages or the paper.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it is possible until it is <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a <unk>
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if they were shouting at <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
And I call it radical to these eight characters.
They are building blocks so that they create many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are crowd.
If you stretch their arms, this person is saying <unk> this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a rare as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the ground.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a tree is quite an idiot.
Remember the <unk>
Two <unk> together, it gets too hot.
Three years; that's a whole fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and one night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Put a board on the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the gate, ask questions.
<unk> played somebody at home?
This person is coming out of a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three women together, are <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical to allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build others 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same as a Chinese learning <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is <unk>
This is a sun put in the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to us, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you where you go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and slow down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the films I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician magician together.
The movie took his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to wear a brilliant dress and take a magic wand
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial complex <unk> of child <unk>
However, the Oz magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took for 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a boy of metal and a boy would say, <unk> a girl dresses like a guard of the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the Oz magician is doing today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
<unk> <unk> shoes to defeat armies were made by the computer of the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing from the Oz magician is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started noticing this when I saw Star Wars my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son as well.
About three years.
I wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight was <unk>  And so he slid in the room and was impressed as a parent leg with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be issues of value, resilience and <unk>
You know, the feeling that Luke was one of a military to overthrowing the government?
<unk> this with the Oz magician.
How does Dorothy his film?
They do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up, right? And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much force capital F, force in movies for our children, and so little on the road of <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
Now, I know by experience that the Princess <unk> doesn't provide the right framework that I had served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think that at the time of the first <unk> I really expected that the credit of the movie, right?
My search is finished, I have a <unk>
Why do you keep standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on <unk> in <unk> and get their reward, and they don't get time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they, boys, are not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our kids, so real and <unk> like <unk> and <unk> but they don't leave out of being films of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all time continues to look at classical after classical, each of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and her son, or two men who are raising a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the critical thing said when he came out of it.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies happens the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not being root and it's already <unk> but maybe we start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comics, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend about the evaluation of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that should be <unk> In the movie, there is more female character who has lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other.
Their conversations are about something more besides the guy you like it?  Right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I rarely see it in the cinema we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success -- a consensus idea of what a Hollywood Hollywood movie is.
<unk> doesn't get the test for <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk>
We have a lot of scenes of men who have profound and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's put it in the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 more popular movies, how many of them believe they have <unk> <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen for Congress, then is fine.
But there is a larger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what I would say to it.
In the United States, one of five women says it's been sexually <unk> once in his life.
I don't think it's mass entertainment guilt.
I don't think movies for children have something to do with that.
Nor do I believe that video videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is there's a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat <unk> with violence and then eating the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools in our disposal as a <unk> <unk> and we hope that that would be, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our kids to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and I'm talking about the parents.
I think we need to show our children a new definition of <unk>
<unk> definition is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite news was about Star Wars you know what it was <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these <unk>
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help us achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories when I tell my <unk> Go and fight and struggle and more stories where it looked like your job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a little girl, I lived in Maine and one of the things I most liked was to look for sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would be luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I went to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I would see with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up with almost 1,300 miles long along the <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we see the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern <unk> of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, to the naked eye, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and we can process it using fake color suddenly the whole place suddenly looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of the landscape by the construction materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used the satellite data to find an old <unk> city called <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire four years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is enormous, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles away.
Before, <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, they moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
To try to find out random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA drivers from NASA to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly higher area that you see inside the circle here, that we think it might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptians making <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the <unk> shots in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, underneath a thick <unk> layer -- we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a <unk> occupation of a number of years covering back from the Middle Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> jobs and <unk> which proves that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry, these are the rocks that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that came back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a jewelry shop that proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find any <unk> here, but we would go back to the place in an near future to <unk>
And more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians at the use of satellite technology so they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote of the Middle Empire of the Middle Empire was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the greatest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to me, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas actually have actually started in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts out the search for shells in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to just close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the house.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> obese <unk>
They are racing in a <unk> race and go back to their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide up against the door of your house.
There are bike bikes all over the parts, wheels that go on their side, <unk> the wheels they end up in <unk> places, the threshold of the gate,
The hall to the hall, or whatever there is the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with the hand.
It was from his chair on a brown horse on a horse on it.
It's a horse talking to you.
You can feel your blue fur, you can tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you want it to get into the mouth.
They slept on one side and enter your living room.
In the room, and making the maximum use of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing over the center, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> A More <unk>
<unk> to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow path of <unk> and from the oven coming to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular competition that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> waiting, I guess this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few men and a few different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers of numbers, looking at them just once.
<unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers.
They give entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people have to be a form of nature.
And I started talking with some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best <unk> memories.
I said, <unk> when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who involved with this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some old old techniques, invented two and two years ago, in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their speeches -- and the medieval scholars were using to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was: How did I have heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful English English and brilliant, although a little bit <unk> said to me, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You meet Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order into a deck of <unk> live on national television.
That would prove to the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what its potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember he had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how far our memory is us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent an afternoon together in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And on return, I read a number of treaties on the memory of writing something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in Latin, and then in Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having a <unk> and disciplined memory was not such a rare thing as you can find today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in providing <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but we also have changed.
We have changed <unk> and I would say that they've changed a cognitive too.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes we seem to be forgotten how to do it.
One of the last few places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined memory <unk> and <unk> is this unique competition of memory.
It's not really so <unk> there's the skills like this.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from London College invited a team champions and the lab.
They wanted to know, will be that it has brains of some brains of a sort of structural way, or different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting difference and meaningful and meaningful between the brains of memory champions and control subjects with the <unk>
When they put them on a MRI machine, they <unk> their brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and shapes of snow <unk> they found that on memory champions <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or they looked like a part of the brain that involves space and navigation.
Why? There is something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is driven as a arms race where each year appears to be someone with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors should get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times memory memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he's about trying to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise <unk> digits <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And as there is a lot of ways of remembering things in these letters, absolutely all the techniques that are used at the end of a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox of <unk> <unk> says this: I tell two people you remember the same word. I say to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's his name.
And then I'm asking you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later on, and I ask them to show you that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who told her that their name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that their work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that is weird.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, really doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
With all the other memories they dance for your head.
But the word, <unk> <unk> <unk>
They use white hats.
They have food in your hands.
They do well when they come back home to work.
Would you probably get some <unk>
And when I was <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this two and a half thousand years ago in ancient <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
History says this: There was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had him hired as entertainment, because before I wanted to give a very good party, they didn't bring up a <unk> he went to a poet.
He stood up, he took his memory poem, and he was <unk> and so soon it was the room of the <unk> <unk>
Tell us all.
But not only killed all of them, but it shattered the bodies.
No one could say who I was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So they couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He stopped standing out, only survivor, in the wake of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with his eyes in his mind, I could see where I had been sitting on every way.
I took the family of my hand <unk> where their loved ones were in the rubble.
What we have <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and that is that no matter whether we're not good to remember names or phone numbers, or a word for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and extraordinary spatial art.
If you let me tell you that I would give you the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to do that.
But I would bet that if you told them to say who I was sitting on the horse or brown character in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of his mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treated of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it memory, the same way I would have done it -- if they had been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely <unk> crazy image, crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then they would see Britney <unk> to remind you that <unk> anecdote that you want to count.
And then they entered the kitchen, and the fourth issue that would talk to would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
So this is how <unk> speakers <unk> their narratives -- not word for the word that will confuse but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> when people thought about the <unk> and the rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The <unk> sentence would be like the first place in its memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got into that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an <unk> event.
Seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting on <unk> I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when someone is <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in its place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes all the <unk> before I see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was entertaining.
I would never have waited for it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train memory.
What it's actually about to do is to improve more and more the ability to create and imagine these images that are <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a pair of security coated with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of an memory.
And I ended up going back to the same contest that I had covered a year before, and I had the idea that I could go into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this might be good for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and phone numbers and <unk> but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks. They have to work that they work.
Because they are based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And it's not necessary to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to build your memory <unk> to benefit from <unk> to benefit with a little bit
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We think when we focus on it deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of them are not <unk> around.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I <unk> the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks to our side. We're going to be so <unk> that we can't even be able to process <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It is a complex issue, so I would give you just a <unk> place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I have six years old, and I lived there at home from my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my child's bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the toilet, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there I all spent looking at the TV set, so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everyone came to me, and every time I was <unk> and I went back in a towel I would all be seen.
And I was like this.
He was <unk> not and hated it.
I hate that journey, hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
That's right.
Those feelings, those emotions I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, nor about areas of areas -- but of those connections, emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- the Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
So 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines it in ways that we don't even even notice us.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would think of -- you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it by based on a building that was built and a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art in art.
And in the 20th century in America, we used it to build homes.
See, these <unk> stable, stable, front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building stuff is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
People who are <unk> the <unk> and governments, are always afraid to innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we find buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Library of <unk> which was ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a <unk> it has this round thing.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, to the other side of the country, the other library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that are constantly driving new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms today.
We were going to push it and <unk> so that we get away from the people.
And all of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we have no choice.
We need to go to the other side and get back to those symbols.
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started to experience <unk> we do <unk> that we can go ahead, and go ahead and over and over the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago we were <unk> from the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
Something really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started bringing those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know like and <unk>
<unk> neon and added bake new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we turned them in skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes are <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
Thank you.
But it was the '80s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
These fantasies could be the <unk> to the French or the Italian.
You may have a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we are recreating recreating <unk>
I really know that this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making <unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
We put the symbols on it, we now have new design techniques for computer -- and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few shapes that are <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> you're totally <unk>
Typically, the pendulum goes back in the opposite direction.
But then something happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk> by Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical scholars and public in general, were completely according to a building.
New York Times <unk> this construction <unk>
Tourism in Bilbao grew up in two and a half thousand percent when the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star <unk>
But how is it possible that these ways, <unk> and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media will spread around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes meant and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
Same thing did the main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these shapes, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new millennium, country with other star architects.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going through the whole architecture. The digital media began to increase the speed of information from information.
Think of, for example, how do you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> they can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end of the end, we're all photographers from architecture, and the building is carried beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere now; that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't happen much time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, 100 buildings more, before I know if that I designed four years ago, it was successful or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a two-year <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to happen.
My theory is that when you think about the emergence of media, it starts to grow faster and faster, even to be in both extremes almost in <unk> and it became effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional loads of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works on a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York City.
It's a vacation.
But that meant two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked like exactly the product, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer, when people began to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a environment, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you did from the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory and to charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think of architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but that have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded by examples of innovation, about how it can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can take the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell you that there is no single response to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are already not those mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and complicated, and you're not a <unk> audience who doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
architects, you can listen, and you don't leave it for architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> of one style to each other, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the extent of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historic brick of red brick with ideas of what a <unk>
This means that a few robots can build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings are attached to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a garage garage in Miami Florida, Florida, it can also serve to do sports or <unk> or even you can get married in the night.
This means that three architects can be able to dream in the East <unk> of New York, and raising half a million dollars in the community attached around that cause, it's no one customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this small pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what it matters is what we build.
So architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they shape the <unk> spaces of local libraries the local libraries the homes where we shape our children, and the <unk> to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it makes it the very great way, typical of the children in a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do is look at the moment is look for the mirror.
She actually loves her reflection.
He <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself the big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do that. And when stopped doing this?
How is that all of a sudden we're not really comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at the math, "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> he's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, despite her mom who says all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
Among what your mom tells you and what his friends, or colleagues in the school says, he doesn't know who believe.
So a video of her itself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others that please leave a <unk> "I'm pretty <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has gotten over 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> they don't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and <unk> teenage teenager, who gets these responses into one of the most vulnerable life of their lives more vulnerable lives.
Thousands of people are publishing like this, mostly girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it doing this?
Well, the teenagers of today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available all the time, talking to you, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never gone.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so they were so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, from being always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There is no divide of life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it is not.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what it's been cleverly collected.
What is the top of the life of someone in front of what is normal in a particular context.
And where are they looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are from the news of the girls now.
<unk> <unk> they follow our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young people are.
But the kids are also not immune to this.
Like those of the superheroes of superheroes and the singers are <unk>
But what's the problem with all of this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, at price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other ways begin to suffer.
Six of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings and how to taxpayers and the field of labor development.
<unk> percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> arguments in the classroom that they don't want to call attention by their physical way.
One in five are not <unk> at all for the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the rainy season, if you don't think you see good enough -- specifically if you don't think you're fast enough -- <unk> a lower note to the average of your fellow of your peers who don't care about that in the appearance.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, United States and China.
It gets regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So to be very clear, we're talking about as you see me, not how you're really.
The lower self-esteem on its body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with low self-esteem perform less physical activity, eating fewer fruit and vegetables, engage in more diets that are not healthy that they can take you to a food disorder, they can take them to a food disorder, they can take them to a food disorder, they can take them to a food disorder, they can take them to a food disorder, they can take them to a food
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at greatest risk of depression.
And we think it's all of this for what they make <unk> decisions like alcohol and drug drugs, diets.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
On 17 percent of women are not presented to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe in the way they see them.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that <unk>
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not good enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first is that we need to nurture trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of programs have a good job without realizing it.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow not only has a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting to be critical for anyone willing to deliver education into body self-esteem to work.
A education is <unk> but to deal with this problem requires each of us to take the reins in the issue and be a better model to keep in the women and girls in our own lives.
I'm challenging the status of the way women are seen and I talked about our circles.
It's not good to tell the input of our <unk> politicians or the size of your <unk> or <unk> that determination or success of a Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people so they are, not as you see them.
All of us can start by doing it, by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can empower people based on their effort and actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you is: When was the last time I <unk> a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and companies, to change our culture, so that our children grow to grow their entire person, valuing individuality, diversity, the <unk>
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make it the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where they believe that they are never going to be able to be seen by being who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who have you in mind?
A <unk>
A <unk>
A <unk>
Her <unk> A <unk>
Could it be simply the woman who is at two remote seats -- what would it mean for her if he was released from that voice <unk> in his interior, he would tell him for not having long legs -- more <unk> a <unk> smaller feet.
What would it mean for her if we did this and make sure it has its potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession with our culture with images are holding us all over us.
But we took our kids to the truth.
You know, the way you look at it is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
They put the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, are going to become safe change agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On top of November of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the Defense Department <unk>
At first of initially they were innocent -- but being attacked by other minor charges in each other, started planning attacks to about 12 of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the headquarters of the United Nations.
Luckily of those plans to be used by an FBI informant in the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center, was not able to avoid.
And later <unk> would be convicted of his participation on that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer, <unk> with a loving mother, teacher school teacher, the two did all the possible for me to give me a happy childhood.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, including most Muslims are going to meet.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't really require a lot to want the same stuff in life.
However, in all of religion, in every human group, there are always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that I think you have to use every single means that they all lived like them.
A few months before her arrest he sat up with me and explained to me that in the last weekends of week, he and some friends, had been going to school in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group was <unk> by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on my shoulder and explained to me how to point to about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot gave the little orange light on the goal and, for all of us, especially of me, the whole goal broke on fire.
My uncle turned to others and Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a son.
All of all, the comment took a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they felt so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be committed to place a loaded with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking lot in the north tower in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and injured other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved me 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I was starting to feel comfortable about someone already was time to pack and get to another city.
As I was always me the new face of the class that often was a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white thing, but it will be the new of the silent class and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent in home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I did not develop social skills, to say <unk> to grow under <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
And I think of me as to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
And one of the first experiences that they put in the test of thinking, was during the presidential elections in 2000.
In a <unk> program where I participated in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence as I had been victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the guys we had done to friendship, friendship, was Jewish for.
I took several days out of the light, and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly, I was very proud to have been able to overcome the barrier that my entire life had been made to me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job, in Bush <unk> a park in <unk>
I found myself with people of all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental about the development of my character.
All life had been taught me that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay was bad <unk>
I had a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most enjoyable and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind, exactly the way I wish I wish to be treated.
For that feeling I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a kid, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that will be homosexual but I know what is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then he came up with the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me be honest with my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure, at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my way to think, and she said something that keeps me in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who's had enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all of that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is about to take violence to violence, you can hear my story and understand that there's a better way, that even though I gave myself to this violent ideology, and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones. For the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to talk about those acts, no such acts as rejection to the actions of my father.
With this simply, I put up here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race -- that children don't have to follow the roads of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you everyone.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this moment, there is a film that fits in their minds.
It's an incredible movie movie.
It's 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and you see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has smell, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood that you project to your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your conscious thinking flow.
The heart of the movie is you experience everything in directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of human being.
Each of us is conscious.
All of us have an internal movie of you, you, you and you.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least I know I have a <unk>
I have no certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not conscious, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these <unk> movies.
Why are we not just robots that we need to make results without experiencing the movie <unk>
So at this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness into science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
<unk> by nature, is objective incredible.
<unk> nature, it's subjective things.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for most of the 20th century, it was going to make that vision.
So psychology is studying behavior in agricultural behavior, and the neuroscience is in fact, but no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of the fantastic work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you that this kind of work of neuroscience will answer some questions that we want to explain consciousness -- questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what it looks like?
But in a sense, those are easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
There's actually no easy problems with consciousness.
So I'm not tackling the real core mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by <unk>
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give the <unk>
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all kinds of emergent behaviors, how they operate the <unk> how they work <unk> how they are <unk> they adapt and <unk> the living organisms are all questions about the target target.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some of the behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we talk to how we speak, how we speak, are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the difficult problem, the question of why is that everything is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still don't have a lot to say.
I am a <unk> scientific story.
I want a scientific theory of <unk> which works for a long time, hit me the head against the wall for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end of the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we were going to focus on this point.
We have a wonderful chain of wonderful, great. We get used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
For another, we don't know how to manipulate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate into our worldview, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that in the early bold principle of being able to deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Your crazy idea is that there is no such problem that's hard to consciousness.
So all the idea of the subjective movie movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the functions of <unk> brain behaviors, and this is where everything needs to be <unk>
Well, more power for him.
So that's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of pure consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity, or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything more basic.
On the contrary, they look principles, and it's built the world.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space space, time, mass laws of Newton. And then it <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space space, time, mass charge, they load up the point of logic, we have to <unk> the list.
The most natural would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, the time, the <unk> physical processes.
We physicists sometimes say we want the fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for all of us, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs -- flies, the flies, flies, the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when you think about my God, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of the raw feeling, makes some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How would someone think of something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is critical.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's a lot less for people in different cultures, where the human mind is more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that we think about the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there's information, there's consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> as a human being, consciousness complex.
<unk> of simple information, very simple.
And something very exciting is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed it with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to be able to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a level of integration of information, as significant, as significant, as significant, as significant awareness.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, microbes, you particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a level of consciousness from zero.
It actually asks a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often looked at the physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using lots of equations, but it doesn't tell us about the reality underlying the bottom.
As Stephen Hawking's explains "Where does the fire fire go?
From vision, the equations of physics can be <unk> but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire at equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's in the center.
This vision, I believe, is the potential for <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had to be consciousness, then I had to be a vegan.
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you have a lot of hungry.
I think that I think about it, this tends to transform your visions, while what matters in ethical terms and moral reviews, is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system from Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right -- they are doing pretty serious ethical problems about the development of intelligent computers and the ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of the <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own <unk>
Or to a local level, an integrated group like the audience in a TED Talk, right now, we have a TED collective consciousness, an internal movie for this whole group of TED <unk> different from the <unk> movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question that you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
And I'm actually safer at the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second of the second is that it's universal.
Now, vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how are those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right way to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem in science and philosophy.
We can't expect to figure it out overnight.
But I think we're going to be able to find that to be discovered.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile.
I went to school, I joined my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to take a community in the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there is a obvious.
She actually hasn't gotten anything."
I went to school, and I had good grades. After school, I had a beneath my mom, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing to be extraordinary at all.
Nothing can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability outside of the equation.
Some years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the class of <unk> studies, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when to your <unk>
And I said, "What a <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for about 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When the people in chairs of wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
<unk> in the classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this child had experienced with people with disability like inspiration.
And we don't. And it's not the fault of the boy, that is, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability aren't our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to get you here.
I'm here to tell you that we've been involved in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is something <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not a bad thing and it doesn't make <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
It may be you've seen one, of the girl without hands drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which is what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the porn porn term -- because we went to a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we're going to engage the disability on benefit from people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, for so bad that it's my life, could be worse.
I could be that guy.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been speaking strange to me, expressing me that I am a brave or a source of inspiration, and this is happening before my work had a public profile.
It was kind of like me getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images will lead to people with disability on benefit from people without disability.
They're there so that you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
I put some things.
But the things that we spend not the things that you may think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I <unk> the so-called social model of disability, that tells us that we are more disability because of the society that we live in that because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very pleased with him.
So the things I need you to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They are simply using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do it, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it's not.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability all the time.
However, I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use a <unk> of <unk> to pick up the things that they fall from --  -- the clever trick of how to charge the battery of the cell phone on the chair.
Great.
We learn about the force and resilience from others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we <unk> and <unk> us.
I really believe that that lie that you have sold us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A bunch of smiles in front of a stretch of stairs hasn't made it become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> on a television screen won't make the <unk> for people who are <unk>
And not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and they have a positive attitude attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a three-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom -- looking at <unk> the <unk> <unk> don't be considered not to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of people who are disability that we are standing up on the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a boy of 11 degree in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user user user <unk>
disability doesn't make us, but question what you think you think about what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the <unk> reality and the professional football man with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, I just respond to one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think about it, they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> hands in the air, but reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because reality reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
They will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to figure it out.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what it is to run through the game of the game to 160 percent blood beating the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds of it, trying to stick it with all of his being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
I took some videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the helmet, give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the <unk> because the idea of <unk> technology is a submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So a moment. Let's get a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in the football field -- from the <unk> perspective.
You may have noticed that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, being their favorite players -- and they've asked me on YouTube and <unk> <unk> can see from the angle of a field <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which you probably know it.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, Oh.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh my God. Ah!
CK: That's the experience of a man on a Russian mountain, <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you put a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, you would pull off a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of a fan.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball through the network?
What will your experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 <unk> like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe <unk> sales <unk>
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality of <unk> when the <unk> <unk> and owners look at the information from what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to gain <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to gain. It gives you money.
So, here is a brief review on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> in Baltimore put a <unk> to his field <unk> so he would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios on the <unk> and after the <unk>
They got more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player going back to your group, and you see your next show in front of you, on a plastic bombsight that you're wearing in, you don't have to worry about losing a <unk>
or <unk> the strategy.
Just go out into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, they hate <unk>
If you lose parties like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But <unk> reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way of playing the game.
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every street corner of the stadium having a view from the high of the people who are down.
You can also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
Good teams will know <unk>
You have information <unk>
This is <unk> to good teams of bad equipment.
So your computer equipment will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis to stop being just for <unk>
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that they're the <unk>
You would have the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> typically, you don't know it, but the system of <unk> would be <unk>
It was <unk> to the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have an open <unk>
<unk> the <unk> but they <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where you can land. However, the receptor sees in its bombsight -- an area of grass and it can modify the career.
It <unk> catching up the <unk> running and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have continued to move it from every angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to do a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality of reality.
We're going to use it just like bread and girls, like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy among human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in another person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much does this technology use for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how ecologically its actions is from the perspective of the <unk>
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it worth doing a <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of kids to think more in space and science instead <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is close.
The questions that we do, the choices we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as always, of us.
Thank you.
Recently I was inspired by 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years came to me <unk> the south end of the county County, which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer trying to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
suicide from the bridge is not practical or <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people think that traveling between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that the each of it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a <unk> every four to five seconds, the body hits about the water about 120 miles per hour.
The impact <unk> bone, some of which are vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones who don't do -- they usually have been <unk> in the water and then <unk>
I don't think that we have this method of suicide <unk> you realize the death of the death that they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to take their life.
I can tell you for experience that the person is on the edge, and in their darker time, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to an official looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> the suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, officers, veterans and psychologists train the new official
This is Jason <unk>
I met him the July 22 last year when he was going to get a call of a drone subject sitting on the <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to an official of the Golden Golden <unk>
Jason was only 32 years and I had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up to here two times before New Jersey to try to survive from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be <unk> and she opened the box.
From her came out of <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open up the box and you don't have <unk>
It was stopped by <unk> leaned on the right, and she was.
This kind of kind of kind of nice, smartphone of New Jersey just take their life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me called me to see what it was.
The parents of Jason had been order.
<unk> harm harm will affect a lot of people.
I ask these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it to be <unk>
What do you do?
What do you say?
In my experience, it's not just to talk, you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't be <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels because they probably don't do it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that somebody is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
So a way to ask you to ask you to ask the question is: Are you going to think about it to end your life, you've had these <unk>
They would get to the person in front of it can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there is nothing that you can do to <unk> social isolation and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you his letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it is with her permission and blessing who were <unk>
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience of being there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, and so on.
I'm still quite <unk> but I see more moments of realizing that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving to San Francisco to see the party of 49 with his father on the 19th of January.
It never came there.
I called the police police and <unk> like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and reported me that the car from Mike was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before not to suffer a real mental disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, I replied to a radio call for a possible suicide bomber on the sidewalk sidewalk near the north tower.
I put my motorcycle on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he looked at me immediately <unk> the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and the next half I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to his mind that day I'll come back on that lane and give your life another opportunity.
When Kevin turned around, I <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I said, "What was what he did to <unk> and gave the hope and the life is <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I'm <unk>
They stopped me to speak and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing to erase the <unk> events -- and you're one of the reasons that Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think that Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness that has been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious, of all those traits -- but thank God, we know what we know.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We thank God for you.
I really blame you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of it, she <unk> <unk> when I visited San Francisco at San Francisco that night, you were looking like the patient.
<unk> I had to do it for <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father, and a drug member of the society.
It talks openly about the events of that day and of his depression with the hope that their story inspire others.
suicide is not just something that I've found in work.
It's personal.
My grandfather would get a poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, I was theft.
This is what suicide.
For most people who think about suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own pain <unk>
Usually this is achieved only three things: sleep, either drug or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and calls out of suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
During that time, I got my hand in three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few that have jumped out of the bridge and lived and you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second they drop from the railing realized that they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should be <unk> to do.
suicide can be prevent.
There is help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not, but in your inner you know what you are, and you ask you, "How do you get involved in that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model, I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had since since a little girl.
My outside I was going to come up with my inner truth, with me inside.
For complicated reasons, I will go over later, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that I'm just beginning.
We all have our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of skin or the beliefs that surround us.
They're people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent even, ignored my story.
I think this <unk> is called a revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> when I was born because of the appearance of my genital genital appearance.
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom asked me, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, my hair is a <unk>
I knew so how do I <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and mystery of it.
Because of my success, I never told myself to share my story, not because I thought to be a bad thing, but because of how the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who embrace me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a Hindu goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight, I was at a party.
I was standing in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman came up to me, and I remember that moment as if something got me <unk> This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the head of a <unk> <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was <unk> she was <unk> from <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in <unk> I won in <unk> and I was a third <unk> among over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was from Queen of beautiful women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went back to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mother who had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that passed my request for the green card that I could go to live in the United States.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you hit the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I was going to put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me in Thailand to 19 years old.
It's curious that in some of the rural cities of Thailand, doing the most sophisticated sophisticated surgery and secure.
So in the U.S., it was necessary to do surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
All of a sudden, my fears were <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it will be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York City who lived his truth, but that <unk> actually put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 of November we make a global waking by the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people who are <unk> and stood in the face of injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth, and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, nor fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that one day there is no more <unk> than 20 percent <unk>
My deeper truth took me to accept what I am.
Do you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure.
In my network of support, to my parents especially, to my family, which I know is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and told me that their parents couldn't embrace it. I took the phone, he would call my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it works, other don't. It's just gender, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all gave a gender to the birth of birth, and what I try to do is put on the table that sometimes that assignment was not block, and there should be a space that could be allowed to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with partners.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> societies, and the parents are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who is known for his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign through education in order for his rights in 2007. And when he was <unk> his efforts in 2011, to the <unk> the National Prize for peace, he became very <unk> a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at human history, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in industrialized societies right from the beginning, when when when when we were born a girl, his birth is not <unk>
It's not welcoming and not by his father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood comes up with the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother was very excited about having a little girl.
When you give birth to the first child, the first daughter, the first daughter, gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he was born, her third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only an eternal mother, but the daughter just <unk> when it grows, it suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you stay home and school to her siblings.
At the age of 12 years in a way, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move around the streets like a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, you have to give him out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of his house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the name of his father and his brothers and his family, and if they were going to get the code of that assumption honor, it could even kill.
And it's interesting that this assumption of course, is not only affecting the life of a <unk> also affecting the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and happiness of his sisters in name of course.
And there's a greater rule of societies that's called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl must be very <unk> very <unk> and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and accepting the decisions of their father and their mother and adult decisions -- even if they don't want.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you put it with an old man, it has to be <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to embrace it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens at the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then gives birth to more kids and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, for being honest, but when I was there and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I got <unk> I thought in his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter for her.
But when I was <unk> all of them were men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she went on and when I was four and a half years old, I put it in my school.
You might be wondering, why should I mention a little girl on a school?
Yes, I have to <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in societies, in tribal societies, is a great event for a young girl.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One part of school means that has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be spent two weeks earlier, when they were going to look at the form of retired <unk> and I was in the relative part of family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in no document.
That was why the courage to my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, he thought he had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends would come to me.
The encouraged to go with me to go to different meetings.
And all of these values, and I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I have <unk> all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for the <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we find a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all social and social activity.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are banned to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and he got up by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog of the BBC, he was offered herself to the New York Times documentaries and talked on every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and nine in October 2012, was shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between my life and death, he was watching my wife -- "I would've <unk> so I went to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please, don't <unk>
We have the fair cause.
<unk> your life for the fact of the truth, for the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right way and God <unk>
These few words were going to be a lot to me, and I didn't ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and I had severe headaches and very strong headaches because his facial nerve was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that was lying on the face of my wife.
But my daughter has never been <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile, and with the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to put it right. Please do it <unk>
It was an comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her to resist the hardest moments, and I'm very pleased to share with you that despite an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any <unk> girl.
<unk> when it's not just the task.
They fight his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special about my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I mean, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
It didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google <unk> group where I have had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> -- but all the work that I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I made it before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you give you to a brain operation.
Are you still like smart or not?
Is it not going to be able to be smart again.
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead sticky part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
And immediately after the operation, I had to decide what they make, of more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if they didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations of combinations and mix and <unk> and try to get them to work with life.
More than I've been saved by that.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided to try to get the dose doses -- because there really doesn't exist a clear map that says it in <unk>
I started to try with different mixes and I was shocked to see how little changes in the dose dramatically changed my <unk> my sense of who I was me, my sense of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a dose and typical chemical dose for a young man and I was surprised to see how my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person all over the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met various kinds of guys like this, or maybe some versions of it.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I was not trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was a <unk> a little bit of <unk> to fix a problem that I had in the front, and it just didn't.
So I couldn't handle it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience I gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to come back, since then I am better with men.
What I tried to do is to try to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, was to regain my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking -- my <unk> of ideas.
I used to think almost always in pictures, and that became my point of key reference to how to get those images that I use to use to create <unk> my ideas, if we were <unk> and new ideas and <unk> experiences.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who are going to have this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how your mind works for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> they really get very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images, from my mind to the screen of the computer.
Can you imagine what would happen if a cinema director was able to use his imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could get the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning brain systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were done by two groups leading in neuroscience.
They both used an functional technology, an functional MRI image to represent the brain. Here you can see the brain scan made by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person looking at an image.
The average column shows the scan of the brain as the individual as you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created by the contents of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between looking at an image and imagine that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack Lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves in visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while their brains were <unk> their brains to create a large pool of brain reactions to the video footage.
Then, I showed you a film with new images, new animals, new animals, and as long as they were <unk> a new <unk>
The computer using just the brain information of the scan <unk> it to show what it looks like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the computer <unk> and on the left, the video I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're pretty close to that.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember that when you see an image and when you imagine that same image, you create the same <unk>
This led to the entire brain scan systems available today, and its resolution has increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you get it?
There are lots of techniques to do that.
One is opening up the skull.
I will not offer me for that.
Many are proposing new techniques of projection by images, even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the <unk> first we have to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> just providing small improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger magnets -- let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort in MRI were to make really big magnets -- right?
But most of the recent advances in the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious and brilliant solutions on <unk> and <unk> in the wild, and receptors in FM systems.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field that are also <unk> magnetic patterns, structured magnetic patterns.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of processing radio processing patterns, we can increase the information that you can get into a single <unk>
Also, we can then break into layers our rising knowledge structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid -- but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even even the direct neural activity activity of it.
Will we be able to put our ideas directly into the digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to diseases of Alzheimer's disease.
We have a few choices more than opening up this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take much more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
Your closet is probably telling some person for the first time you love, or tell someone who is pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have in life in life.
It's all a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can change the experience of having lived and to have come out of that closet a universal thing.
It doesn't fear, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and he was there, I had to go through various phases of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, I'll quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> like a <unk>
And I will be slope out of my pants <unk> and I would have broken my head back, I would ask me usually a kid -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And he would have uncomfortable uncomfortable at the table.
I got my jaw a little more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father said, <unk> the newspaper and <unk> a cold hand look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and it would be <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a boy between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it came again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A familiar, but this time was prepared and I was about to get into the female issues on the table.  He had the quotes from Betty <unk>
dating. <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina of the <unk> <unk>
And so I took a breath down and I went down and my backs and my backs -- a four-year-old kid with a pink dress -- and I was not a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "Are you guy or <unk>
So I would take a long breath again, and I put it up near it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is <unk>
I have the short hair like the one of a boy, and I saw your kid, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
Well, I'm more than a girl with a <unk>
And that little girl looked at me by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all it. You just go, "Oh, yeah, you're a girl.
What about <unk> <unk>
It was the hardest conversation that I ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what the walls.
You just know how one feels like living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from you or you or you or yours.
<unk> I'm going to give you a hundred reasons why I get out of my closet it was harder than out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who have declared in bank <unk> is harder to tell you it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is more difficult to tell your five year-old son that you are going to give them up.
There is no hardest thing there is only the difficult thing.
We must stop putting up what is difficult to make it hard for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our fears, and we should just feel empathy because we all live in a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they may make security security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse, a horse, a dress and shoes of <unk>
It wasn't the lesbian <unk> who was ready to fight any four-year-old kid who would get into the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my father, gay, and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my full strangers I have spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was <unk>
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't throw that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable tribes was in my sister.
It was the first time that a lot of the guests knew that I was gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came around the tables and finally came up with a where my friends were friends of my parents, people who knew me for a years.
And after talking a moment, one of the women <unk> <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of gay account had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it is <unk>
<unk> you meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite <unk> Will <unk>
And you know who would be <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but I hope to actually actually show his support, to get me to know that I was from my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as they have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you can do.
That's how hard conversations are still my strong point.
Ask anyone that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of every country is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no armor, but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> others must know that we don't do it.
Number two: Be <unk> Just <unk> <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If you say to your parents that maybe they could be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be embarrassed by that.
And some of you can come out wounded wounded and get them out of what they've done, but they will never be worried.
And yes, maybe some people will feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark hand, <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very themselves, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen intelligence, an productive example has been this famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is so interesting as the question of if a submarine can <unk>
When I <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism to the computer <unk> like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the mechanisms underlying underlying intelligence.
Let's take a step.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from a alien race that you don't know about the biology of Earth or neuroscience of Earth or intelligence on Earth, but they have amazing telescopes and you can look at Earth, and you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept about intelligence on Earth, it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain moment at the time, the asteroids that we put on the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And that's why I claim that this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines that I think, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted to the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that replace the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the planning of robotic movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all of these different issues and <unk> together, I said, we've already several years ago: there is a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There is only one equation for intelligence <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a strength, F, which acts in order to maximize future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action or keeping the open choices with a T, with the diversity of possible accessible, and yes, to an imminent future time, <unk>
In a nutshell, to intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
Your intelligence is trying to maximize future freedom of action and keeping options open.
And so, if you realize this equation, it's a natural person, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
It was the level of human <unk>
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have trend to more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings as we do.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not just correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually arises directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> -- designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy production in any system that you find inside.
Amazingly, <unk> could spend multiple tests of animal intelligence, play human intelligence testing, and even make money <unk> actions, all of them without the way to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
So just like a single <unk> human standing here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to be able to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for <unk> and <unk> technology.
This ability for tools will have applications will have applications in intelligent manufacturing.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling off opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we have successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> <unk> new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly constantly and keep the network on the very connected network.
This same <unk> capacity also has applications also has applications in healthcare, in energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a police fleet discovering successful, finding success and using the Panama Canal to broaden their reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, we see <unk> spontaneously discover and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of negotiating actions, increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability to risk management will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of human cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term of using the robot, the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if you were looking at smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion there.
The machines are attached to us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion <unk> in reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take control of every possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually emerge directly from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the goal.
They often ask me, how do you look for goals of this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go to the descendants of the descendants of helping them build artificial intelligences or help them understand human intelligence, is the following: The intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions on its own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
In the last few years, we've extended our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, what it points that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a Space Telescope which measures the faint light intensity of stars when planets go ahead of them, and they jam a little bit of that light to get to us.
The data collected by Kepler shows the sizes of planets besides the distance between them and their mother.
And together, this helps us to understand if these planets are small, and they are <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their <unk>
At its time, this gives clues about whether these planets are <unk> or not.
Unfortunately, while we are finding this trove of potentially <unk> worlds our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The 2014 year was the hottest one.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, now are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused on global scale have led to our ability to disrupt its course.
But I'm not a weather scientist, and I'm not <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more planets I look at planets like the Earth, more of our own planet.
Every single one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the earlier planet and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbors to Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and even though it will be a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world shown by a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past, and in part, that's why we studied both to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track their surface in search of clues about <unk> of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
private companies now offer not just short space flights but also the possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all these <unk> images remind us of the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still in <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and <unk> places, the air is cool and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I care that this enthusiasm for the colonization of Mars and other planets will go with a big and sad <unk> the implication and the belief that Mars would expect to save ourselves from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable the Earth.
So I like to like the exploration, exploration, I'm deep disagree with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but say that Mars will be there to motivate humanity is how to imagine that the captain of Titanic will tell us that the party of Titanic will have place later on the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for climate exploration and preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of trying to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk>
They are only closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of the ground, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with an experiment, the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, Enrico Fermi asked, did we have realized that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the Fermi of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to come to consider to live between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the planets is to protect the origin of the planets that we have development.
It's arrogant to think that just the colonization, <unk> we will save ourselves from ourselves, but the <unk> and the <unk> exploration, can they work together.
If we really believe in our ability to tackle the hostile environments for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the easiest task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were at the dining table, where I had <unk> them.
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all very closed.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to it, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back to my friend's friend's house for night because I had an early flight in Europe to the next morning, and I was my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but they certainly don't even get more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, that despite the circumstances, room right there.
I'm a neurologist <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases your heart rate -- they will transform the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the <unk> of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started wondering, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in place that would make bad things happen.
Or at least, if bad things are wrong with it, which is the probability of total catastrophe <unk>
So I started thinking about that, but up to a month after my thoughts.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who was the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> retrospective here.
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that you could go wrong, then try to figure out what can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, they will take a place for things that are very easily <unk>
This sounds common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make track of the location of the important things, where the fine, where the fish are, where the fish are living in, where the <unk> tribes and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that enables you to find your nuts.
And if you ask someone if someone actually did the experiment, they cut the sense of the <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't go too much, not so good for things that move too much.
This is the reason for losing keys for the car, <unk> reading and <unk>
So in my house -- a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a drawer in particular.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and you have to get it to it with it, you will always be there when you get them.
What about <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit cards license, no <unk> by mail in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases your brain.
<unk> is wild and <unk> thinking.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not at the best time, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there is perhaps not more stressful than when you faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved one, to help you with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all of us in medical decisions, and in fact to make financial decisions and social decisions and any kind of decision that we have to take away from which would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I have received the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug to help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, you may even know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, is a statistic that you should ask for which most physicians don't want to talk, and pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who need to take a drug or to have surgery in any medical procedure before they help one person.
And you have to think about what kind of <unk> statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor wouldn't tell me something if it wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and if it's somebody's fault. It's from scientists like me.
We have not understood the <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> which you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they help someone else to help your person?
300.
This is according to research from cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I am <unk> the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid one year before they avoid a single heart attack, stroke brain event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 to my <unk>
Why not? <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a statistic more, and it is, <unk> from the <unk> effects, right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in the five percent of the patients.
And those include things that include physical muscle pain and <unk> <unk> pain, but now they think, five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress you don't think clearly.
So think about how we do this over time, so you don't have to make the kind of thinking of thinking on the act.
300 people take the pill -- right? A person has spent five percent of the 300 have to be side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get harmed by the drug to help the drug.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I'm just saying that you should have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is required, is part of the first informed consent principle.
We have to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I have launched this number in the air the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that more is done in the older men in the age of 1950s, <unk> from prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
This is 49 surgeries by one person who has helped it.
And the side effects in that case, are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include so-called erectile <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before time the questions that you can make that we take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make it all on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice a lot of times, you want a <unk> life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain towards the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
So Face the face with a predator, you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very quickly. They could be the lunch lunch so that none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that go through the window during those moments of stress is the rational, rational, like <unk> <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to start to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail every time.
The idea is to think about the future how you could be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help us minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> at the night of snow in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the gate door, a very easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards I have not <unk> and lots of email I haven't read it.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm managing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical symbol of her.
It means <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two stronger <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> and it looks like it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be made to be a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, the <unk> besides a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over over the 1970s and over the time, he mixed together with local signs, and developed the language that we know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, actually are in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, it's as if I lived in a foreign country in a foreign country, following blindly <unk> and <unk> behaviors and standards without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound sound?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I have seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example ...
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise to eat the potato potato <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating sure that they weren't <unk> in the <unk>
This is all called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the label more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of sound.
And I'm always waiting for the sound -- the sound is going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> for decide.
They are going to go on to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle and subtle <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, to make it with my thumb so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why I have only four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my art art.
Is it going to remind me of the art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that we don't only experience through our ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound ownership and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me about sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was something of a <unk> person.
And sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic job, or I could <unk>
I chose that I was <unk>
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me and become my voice.
So I'm able to be able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and a identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, to <unk> their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value -- just like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If you will not continue with this practice, I feel that I could put it in the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with the sound like my new artistic and artistic environment, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was amazed by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note you can't capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can tell you about a concept in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can actually affect the whole meaning as much of the signals as the sound of the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a piece of the piano, so you understand how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
<unk> is divided into a lot of different <unk> parameters
If you put a <unk> different for each finger as you play the piano, like the facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand, and so while the piano, English is a linear language, as if it just goes into just a screen at once.
However, <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers <unk> to express a concept of a concept or idea in <unk>
If just a key key to change our own, it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different <unk> parameters you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal in that."
This is the <unk> signal, in that."
I'm looking at.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the lens of music?
If I had to create a sign and fold it over and again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is all day."
If you get it, and you get the speed, the visual speed, looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can say is the same thing can be said about <unk>
"All <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time expresses in <unk> and how far the distance into the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> it's two hands, and the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea and dramatic at the same time, let's go back again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific pace of four times per <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically <unk>
Look at <unk> right, <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you with me?
All with your hands high.
Now we're going to do it both in the head as your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, so well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third one. Please go back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Now look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest. But they transmit very different.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very tight world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, automatically doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines the social value and allow the <unk> to grow its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> I don't have to hear to learn how to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich treasure trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I would like to start opening your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, you can get love in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would tell me, "Can you define everything, but then you have to <unk>
freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I must say, because adults would lie to us to protect ourselves from the awful truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults are also <unk> and they are not very good to clean each other.
The country, country, now I'm an adult and teach people and invention in the Hong Kong school.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of trash.
So as a good citizens, I took the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic.
It's kind of scary.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out of these big ships and networks, and they collect those plastic pieces to actually study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to be able to use these enormous <unk>
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dreamed of invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work for the kids who are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I will tell you, the kids who manipulate tools and they feel great and safe.
Not exactly.
And back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce it into the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of their <unk>
That we do.
I leave my imagination for my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas from every child and try to figure it into something that we hope to work.
So we decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the children will become very much with robots.
Then we created very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in the creation of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we made the light lamps and it would take it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and through the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor, while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each particle, to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this step step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would take it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I do research my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and <unk> with this <unk>
A child, maybe under 10 years, cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water you drink, is the water where the water is going to take off the water where they were living in.
You can also see that the water is brown, the mud and the oil and the oil is also brown and when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> through all kinds of things that produce different spectra? What can help identify what's in the water.
We started this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help in a remote way to other children.
I was forced to do a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was as violent that he started with various giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> various cities on the east coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant to Fukushima, a nuclear power plant, close to water.
And today, according to the reports about 300 tons is still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of <unk>
If we go to the West Coast, we can measure radiation radiation, everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the <unk> coast -- and the most part, it looks like safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year since the accident and researching the other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we get to the center of <unk> here is the use of different masks here.
It might seem that they didn't take the serious work -- but they did because they are going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Along with them, we discussed the data that day and talk about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> we introduced pigment to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this we were able to notice that the radioactive powder will spread from the summit of the mountain into the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an estimate of <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil expedition the closest to the nuclear power station until date.
We get close to a mile of the nuclear center, and with the help of fishermen on the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a tracking device as we invent and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been really exciting to work on these different scales -- also with very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all these things.
So the classroom became so much a little bit so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the larger space dedicated to social impact and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong -- and it's a place where we can work with wood metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, of fibers, you can basically build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where dreams of children can actually become reality with the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the advanced population, transforming their standard wheels in new vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are in the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientists, creators <unk> we have to prepare the next generation to be worried about the environment and the people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes <unk> two radically opposite cultures.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the one of a single silk thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
You place it over the environment, the other one would think of it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the marble <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool of <unk>
But living creatures are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information needed for every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production in mass.
And the assembly lines have dictated a world made out of the parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> of different functions.
But you don't find any <unk> material in the wild.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins is thin with <unk> pores <unk>
The backs of the back are <unk> with little <unk>
You act mostly as a filter the other thing as a barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no parts, no <unk> no <unk>
It's a system that gradually vary its functionality through the variation.
Here's a broken screen, which represents my view of the world <unk> the double personality of every designer and an architect to work in between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine, and the organism, between assembly and growth, and growth between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right -- analytics and synthesis, shown on the two screens behind me.
My work, in your simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving out of the assembly and getting up to growth.
You probably ask why now?
Why wasn't this possible 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where we -- four disciplines that offer designers to have access to tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scales, a large scale of scale, like this robotic arm with a cost of 24 feet in diameter that one day not very far to print <unk> buildings and graphics to the nanoscale <unk> made of <unk> genetically altered <unk>
So here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the old Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every single opening is only size to form the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> this was for a fashion fashion fashion <unk> with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with 3D printing <unk> we printed this layer and 3D <unk> 3D <unk> between the cells, I'll show more objects like that.
This helmet combines <unk> materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of an MRI scanner.
That designers have access to this high resolution <unk> and the instruments of <unk> it allows us to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair a chair and comfortable and also <unk> sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator came back to nature to <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern of <unk> it becomes <unk>
We put up this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, varies its functionality not by addition to another material or another <unk> but continuously <unk> and <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts of nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jewish house, but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and actually define a lot of what I care about.
Like she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends up the Earth to grow a tree <unk> <unk>
For that first tree -- there was no difference between trunk, branches, <unk> and <unk>
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the earth made trees to grow trees with twigs, cortex, <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would the design look like if things were <unk>
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we were looking for the material that was able to do the kind of material in the tree with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons per year is produced by organisms.
We think that if we could tune your properties, we could generate structures that could be <unk> <unk>
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  <unk> a lot of husks of oyster husks <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of property, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures -- it was built a system with multiple fog <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could change the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from one <unk> material -- feet long, 100 percent recyclable material.
When the pieces are lists, you can dry it to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> that first first happened on the planet makes a billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria engineered to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make its transition without problems of <unk> to mesh and if it expanded even more to windows.
A tree is <unk> <unk>
Working with a old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a kind of structure of shrimp husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best two: for <unk> objects designed to <unk> in the sea, and they <unk> <unk> life and placed on the ground, they'll help grow a tree.
The <unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control their flow.
So like the board, we did our own table, new forms of life created <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals that are <unk> new biological <unk> within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothing, it's two <unk>
The first one is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
It turns out the light in sugar, the other power power and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it never was <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution for design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the <unk> tract that will help us to make these bacteria and that they make their function off.
And so we started growing those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material as <unk>
If we wanted more photosynthesis, providing more transparent channels.
This system <unk> <unk> when you stretch from one end to another, it's 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football, and 10 times more than our little gut <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels in my clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are early fashion -- only half is <unk>
What if design is <unk> the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the damaged tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer actually prints material out.
It also knows that nature doesn't make it like that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture of a home within which they were <unk>
The manufacturing of manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, put those fibers to each other.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm will first turn into the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then it starts <unk> a cocoon of compression.
<unk> and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves into a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process, we attach a small magnet to the head of a patch of silk <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of <unk> of silk <unk>
However, when you put the silk worm on a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we had a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> was transmitted directly through the environment.
They often give up the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates and we could shape the brutal silk without boiling one <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we ran this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot, making silk <unk> and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew the silk worms are moving into the darkest areas and <unk> so we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
And so we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat by heat the silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We asked <unk> worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to meet with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is great integrity, and it was right.
By <unk> silk silk about silk, which is <unk> they give all this pavilion on integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> silk worms -- <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other filled with empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which takes us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, that leads to a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by design, which demands of us, for the first time, that we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they were asked for the first time.
They can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked English, the <unk> and art and started websites and also playing the guitar in a band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And I usually like to try and persist anyway, so I have dedicated a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it gets to <unk>
And I have to give you up.
But then I got excited about something else, something completely different, and I was going to get involved in it, and I get to absorb and I feel <unk> I've found that <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to give you up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern made a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I should choose one thing, deny all my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason I had so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad at me for nothing.
I was worried about commitment, or to be dispersed, or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to give me back then.
Ask themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where you would think of the culture.
You ask first question: "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody matters what they would get to that age.
It's considered a naive question to trigger nice responses in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question is about again and again as we grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of being the nice thing that takes away the dream.
Why?
Now, if this question is inspired by kids to dream about what might be, it's not inspired to dream with everything that they might be.
In fact, it does the opposite.
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>   and he's a <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate, or the real calling the idea that each of us has something to do during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and devote your life to it.
But if you're someone who's not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that show your curiosity and a lot of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a breath, so say.
It could help if you divide up in three and multiple parts: potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we could use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of Renaissance, the ideal was who was well in multiple disciplines.
Barbara stands for us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a sort of adapting to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or <unk> you should win.
But what I've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, traveling mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
At <unk> and Rachel came up with this idea of its unique <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
That's where new ideas.
And <unk> with all of their background, can access a lot of these points of intersection.
The second <unk> superpower is learning quickly.
When we were <unk> we become <unk>
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to <unk> because we have been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new zone that we need, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a child, they had an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before becoming a writer, <unk> was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the highest sales of sales when its practices started to write the compelling launches for the editors.
It rarely is a loss of time to go to what you would give to you even if you end up with it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower superpower is adaptability. It means the ability to transform anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, others, a web pages website, sometimes a teacher, sometimes teacher, sometimes James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different roles depending on the needs of its clients.
Science magazine defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to deal with the market needs that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quick learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three abilities that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
<unk> from <unk> knowing that they wanted to be neurosurgeons <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist, can be diving deep and put ideas in practice, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that we think about how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a lot of people are told to simply be more like their fellow <unk>
Once you said this, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope this is this: <unk> with the <unk> <unk> whatever it is.
If you're a heart attack, then you go through all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, "You know, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep in curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
I'll get the intersections.
We <unk> our inner cabling it leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, we have the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I joined a woman called <unk> they took it to a psychiatric facility in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until, unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a look and found strange plates and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even most amazing thing.
If we had been living today, we couldn't give her more help than the one who <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They've discovered antibiotics and vaccine to protect ourselves from infections, many treatments for cancer treatments, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and so much more.
But a little bit of progress in treating Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's disease now affects 40 million people around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that by the way, it will include many of you.
If you wait to live to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's is almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that they spend their partner with Alzheimer's disease or helping to take care of a friend or be dear to Alzheimer's.
In America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One five dollars of medical care spend on Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs of five times in 2050, as 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been done relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's disease is the only one you can't afford to cure or even slow down its development.
We understand less about Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more in cancer research that Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a number of annual deaths from deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is because of a more fundamental cause of consciousness.
Because this is what few people know, but all the world <unk> Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, we all have -- scientists, severe Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only a picture of a healthy aged aged a healthy brain compared to the patient patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleashed a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease significantly life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century.
For nearly a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper it folds up as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these dots <unk> they end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots come out on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and identifying what step out is complex, like defuse a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that is blocked and then create a drug that I do.
Until recently, most of you have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, creativity, physical, engineers, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of drugs that jam specifically this step to stop disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a couple of videos from what happened when you test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that get into each other within them, as in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly <unk>
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at the early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial outcome, but research like this sample that Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to convince you that Alzheimer's disease is a disease and if we do it, we can get it out.
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, industry, and <unk>
That was essential to move into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden caregivers of their loved ones and night, are often too much <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not, in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need to themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I put this article in the New York City, New York Times in January of this year.
In love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and in my own experience of testing it myself one night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers are <unk> to get a more personal more and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you put in front of another person?
And <unk>
<unk> that are <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> to your partner what you like from him or she said, I know I know so honest about this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me the attention that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with somebody who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to be waiting for.
But we had a good story, but I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the naked eye.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask yourself, keep it together.
And the reason I think it's going to be <unk> this is because I've done this question over and over over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the article was published, I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had encouraged me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can get to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would reach a few thousands of view.
And that came a good burden of attention to a relatively new relationship.
But we had no idea.
The paper was published on Friday at night, and on Saturday, this happened on the traffic of my blog.
And on Sunday, I had already called the <unk> Show and Good <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million views, and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust by writing about <unk> experiences but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news, and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called the <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they always did the same question: They were still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages showed immediately.
They were students and journalists and <unk> and <unk> like this.
I was interviewed in radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where your <unk> is.
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers by proving the study in these different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
<unk> television interviews, and he refused to make pictures of us two.
I think that I was afraid of becoming the icons of the <unk> process -- a range of that I didn't feel at all the <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study works, they wanted to know whether they really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce love, not just a adventure, but a real, love love.
But this was a question I didn't feel like I was able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months old, and I felt about everything, that people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if you put it together or not, and you get <unk>
If the answer was not, it would make the experience of making these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead, I was looking at encouraging <unk> <unk> between university students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were felt closer after doing that, several more studies, they also used coordinate <unk> protocol as a quick way to create trust and interaction among strangers.
They've been used by the members of the police and the community, and they've used it among people of the opposite political ideologies of it.
The original version of history, which I tried last summer, which I set up with personal questions with four visual contact minutes was cited in this article, but unfortunately never <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and said to me and said to me with <unk> I tried the studio and didn't work.
He seemed to be <unk> for it.
And I said, you want to say that you would give you from the person with whom you would do.
Well, he did a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, "But they became better friends?
<unk> that they managed to get better after <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that neither of you are looking for when it's about love.
I came across the studio for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation through it.
I had had that relationship since he had 20, which I was supposed to virtually my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or could I live without him.
So I'm going to focus on science.
And I did everything I could find about romantic love, and I expected that that that would be sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just knew for the book that I was writing but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel such as bad as I felt then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what we do.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I look for is sometimes more than as reasonably as to reasonably demand me.
What I'm looking for about love is an assurance -- not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but that I'm going to continue to be <unk> endlessly by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way in order to somehow mitigate some of the risk of risk -- and this is a very <unk> story, because in love to feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that says, still keep together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, let's ask us to ask questions more difficult, questions like, how do you decide who you deserve your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how do you know when to cut and look at it.
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live in your partner?
I don't know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more thoughtful conversation about what it means to love somebody.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a well-known study and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love it's not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> love didn't happen.
<unk> love -- because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, there was nothing that I was supposed to do.
I didn't think how many times we would have both to make that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he was always choosing or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded 36 questions, having chosen to love somebody as generous, kind of fun and fun and he expressed that choice in the largest day in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what I think of, and what you might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choice someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a couple lesbian lesbian and in a certain way, I got a <unk> of the forest.
One of New York City, a time ago,  -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and I took a dollar ticket a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some bizarre <unk> or some aliens find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
But anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a time I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from <unk> and <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took it all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> I <unk> my style, I Martin, he covered the resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added a little bit more resin on the canvas, thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, the opposite happened. In some way it seemed like it increased size, as if it was that you get the text with a <unk>
So I made <unk> I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding some electronic elements, frogs strange bottles that I was going to find out the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow by drawing the same as you do about a dead body, in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of specimens.
First, <unk> that you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, to go to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I got interested in the human form, <unk> sculptures of natural <unk> with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass, similar to the drawing on a window, and then on the other window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, which I call <unk>
For <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
You know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 40,000 kilos.
<unk> meters long.
It's got <unk> so it's 10 meters of <unk>
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of the blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals with animals travel between two worlds.
They are going to be the <unk> of <unk> to this <unk> <unk> <unk> where they were <unk>
This is where the creatures with shrunken heads are headed by <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out in a hand while the other hand is clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a mythological thing that keeps Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a look at the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird <unk> and spits out this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> of a snake tail that binds to the <unk>
Anyway, your tail turned into a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go up, you know.
His tail ends up in a balloon <unk> made out of terrorist cards.
You've got them <unk>
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
Very <unk> at your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material and material is <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive form in a form of human being, and they travel in the 20, four or 12 at once.
They're like cells, they come together, they divide together.
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> that weighs 1,300 pounds of a human trapped inside.
This has a small cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> he's the chest, you can give them the ticket.
I'm going to show you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of your chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it is, it has a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick primer on these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and go into the head of this strange statue of this strange statue there.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> cavity there.
Can you take it out.
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick.
Within this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, a radio, and a museum, a museum, a publishing arm that spreads the whole content we do in the world, and a garden.
And we looked at the box and all the people on inside hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you have a <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we came to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, the borders, it doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with <unk> and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your mind?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first of all, the <unk> and other organs.
Take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug will change in your body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When they take drugs that are <unk> these are going to reduce the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart of stem cells.
But they are also known for their side effects <unk> in its most negative, because in the time that it takes us to get to the current -- you will be <unk> and worse even by the time that it takes to get to their destiny, which is where it is more important, in HIV HIV.
These are regions of the body like the metastatic <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't get easily in the bloodstream.
However, after treating treatment, viruses can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great issue of HIV treatment with current drugs that is a <unk> treatment for life <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly into the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you're used in <unk> for the care of wounds and surgery surgery -- they can be used for anything <unk> including transportation <unk> of medicines.
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser to open or drill extremely small holes that open and closing the cells infected with HIV to introduce medicines.
You better ask, "How do you do that?
We sent a little laser beam laser on the membrane cell with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of <unk>
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro technology or plate plates.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a three heads.
With the first head, that's our laser, we're going to make a <unk> in the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, and he runs to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly in the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the overall eradication of HIV body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all the research researcher in our case, a laser treatment treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying groups armed groups of armed groups as terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they are not firing.
My goal is to understand these agents of violence generators.
I do work work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups are key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and non-state actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even need <unk> or <unk> in any process of resolution of successful agriculture.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one looks at what they do when they don't get it?
<unk> and <unk> not armed <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent struggles against Israel.
Since its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also set a political party -- a social service network, a social <unk>
Likewise, the Palestinian <unk> known for his suicide attacks against Israel, also treated the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
Are they multitasking themselves.
It was going to be a complex machine, radio stations, radio channels channels, websites web websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups also invest in a complex fundraising fund -- but by using business <unk> for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funding, to recruit them better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build professional and they run hospitals, they put professional training programs put professional training programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
Local groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in a Afghanistan were held by the war, or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated price for the population.
But in general, providing social services that means to fill in a <unk> a <unk> gap by government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 of Palestinian <unk> cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at existing groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill out gaps by the government, and they emerge as armed and political groups participate in violent struggle and they give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated people are these organizations, we can be able to engage them as something contrary to a state.
How do we call a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory, running all their functions, collect the garbage, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states of states, without state and hybrids and the weakest of them are states, like in the Middle East -- and the current the Middle East, and they fill that <unk> <unk>
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in tools not military tools.
It has to be on the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we better understand groups -- we will understand better how incentives to offer to the transition from violence to nonviolent violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors are not <unk> the military power can win some battles, but we won't give us peace and stability.
To achieve these goals of these goals we need long-term investments to fill that gap of security, to fill that gap of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly <unk> <unk> it would be unfair to the <unk>
I'm <unk> but quite bad.
And I was so excited about it as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> and then on the interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and the age of 20 years, I had some strange ideas on the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and that they will have sex. Like if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how they're treated for women around the world and anger, in particular, it looks perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be feminist.
Being labeled as feminist was a <unk> a taboo and nasty.
I felt like a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's equal or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They would have the same pay.
We have right now to travel around the world as well as <unk> or violence.
We have right to use it and accessible the contraceptives and services that are <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There is more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition and so much more.
We have to have to look at these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear. I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I take a job at work, I hear rap music at all.
Although the letter degrades women and offends me, the classic <unk> classic of the yin by yang <unk> is amazing.
Did you actually come up with your <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> for my own musical understanding.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is everything I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the collection of garbage, the <unk> and maintenance maintenance in <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion magazines and nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies about the fairy tales that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's his election, and I'm not who to be <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his kids, they will raise that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
So let's get this problem.
So we had the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color, the gay workers, gay workers, <unk> for white women and <unk>
<unk> if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist <unk>
It also happens to the next thing, as I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk>
We hope it will be <unk>
When we get older, we take them very taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider myself to be <unk> before I try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative people and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be <unk> as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> by fear that it means that <unk> fear not being able to achieve with a little realistic expectations.
Let's take an example to <unk> or like I call it <unk>
In the last few years it's a feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music <unk> in 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a show of <unk> to see this pop star up to pop up up to the feminism and asking women and young men and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, critical critics began endless arguments if they were to <unk> it was not a feminist.
<unk> their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult and adult woman.
<unk> perfection of <unk> because we're still fighting a lot, we want a lot, we need so much so <unk>
We are going to go far beyond sane and <unk> to <unk> God's feminism of any woman <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
Bad conception.
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I hear music -- I am creating a lawsuit for artists that would be more happy to give us a supply of limitless.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they make their change effectively affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does it have their music so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and easy to justify an worst choice.
But when bad decisions are required to make it harder for women to achieve equality, gender equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
These are two girls and <unk> and bright and also very brave. I want to grow up in a world.
They are getting rid of the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is all about sexual violence against women as sport, including the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema elsewhere when movies don't treat women more than like symmetrical objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their peers, and <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post it in the magazine to participate in their project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to try to participate in this kind of projects, we can also dare to be even more like us to be empowered to overcome the barriers to the decision jobs.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements is going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and expect our decisions to come to the top, to the people in the power of directors and producers of cinema and music producers and music, <unk> <unk> people who can make great decisions and more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also tell the courage to do, well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, most of all, because I was going to get my voice to me -- and my feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to address what happened.
A few kids were telling me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I read my voice, and after I didn't dare to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it wasn't nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and scientist also discovered that if it was a little brave another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us are nothing about telling us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I argue the stark reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little bit courageous, when you need that <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> to have visited <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then ran across the border to Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with a immune system, is one of the most easily <unk> diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century ago, but many of the children involved in the outbreak <unk> had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, was not the paper that broke the argument about autism and the Afghan and Afghan vaccines, because it was a <unk> fraud by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know that most of you knows, but millions of parents around the world remain <unk> that vaccines are going to put in danger to their children of being autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the spread of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> who I'd heard about she creates their entire professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, estimates of prevalence continued stable just three or four children per 10,000 <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
It's about fundraising and funds like <unk> <unk> they refer to routinely with autism as an epidemic as if I could give you another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If it's not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Centers for Disease Control what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> and "A better detection of <unk> to explain these numbers.
But that type of language didn't <unk> a lot of fears of a young mother who seeks the face of his son of two years, the eye contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be <unk> why were they so <unk> in the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital. In <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients that seemed <unk> a private worlds that looked like a private, private worlds.
You could have fun for hours by shaking their faces, but they were <unk> by <unk> as when they don't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the decade of 1950, as the main authority of the world on the subject, stated that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome while <unk> <unk> places like South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis of <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had turned to nine every 10 children sent up by other doctors to be autistic without giving you a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of childhood <unk> caused by young parents.
These kids, he said, they were very carefully in a fridge that we didn't know.
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that they cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I reached the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite <unk> he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents were <unk> desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1980s, that researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> the cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> mothers was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John were warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how difficult it was to raise a girl as the Susie!
To defend in the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, and their friends named Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They started a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
I took a suburb to London called <unk> to try to find children autistic in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse diverse ones.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were engaged in their fascination by astrophysics, or the genealogy of <unk>
Otherwise, these kids didn't fit in <unk> and <unk> as they said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody had ever realized these children before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> talked German, and he <unk> it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a graduate school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for children learning with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic began with a music classes with music, and the kids followed their games on the afternoon.
And instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's as he <unk> in the life of life that required <unk> <unk> and spaces around the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, <unk> he called them their little teachers, and he went to help in the development of methods that were especially suited to them.
<unk> <unk> saw autism as a continual diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of <unk> and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in architectural <unk> as the awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was more there until I mean, that for success in science and art, a matter of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> found that <unk> was wrong with the one that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnostic of the diagnostic that they <unk> the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes in <unk> by replacing the limited model of <unk> by a broad and parasites.
These changes don't fell on <unk>
<unk> when I was going, and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these people around the world see an adult adult for the first time.
Before he came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance performance is like <unk> <unk> and <unk> recognition -- <unk> <unk> and parents all over the world knew what was autism.
At the same time, they were introduced the first easy clinical tests to use to diagnose autism.
I should no longer have a connection with that small circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> changes in the criteria and the introduction of these evidence created a network, a perfect storm of the awareness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> like they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they were hoping that it was, making the people with autism and their families finally had support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame for vaccines in the <unk> and a simple, powerful history of credible as bad as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the center of preventing one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, people are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are because of solving the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of operating operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's broken up.
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily easily <unk> social <unk> and they suffer from a attention deficit to detail.
No doubt people are autistic to live in a world that was not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> who believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in understanding teachers, employers with capacity, communities, communities, communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the boat of the <unk>
As we move into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste or a brain.
Thank you.
